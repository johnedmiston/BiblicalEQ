<p>The central teaching of this book is that as part of their redemption Christians 
  are to take on the emotional life of their Saviour and that this occurs as a 
  result of the power of the Holy Spirit who transforms us into the image of the 
  Son of God. If the Holy Spirit is indeed the divine dynamic and the agent of 
  deep emotional transformation then we should see some evidence of that in His 
  work in the life of Jesus. Obvious questions arise that we will investigate 
  such as: Did His baptism and empowerment with the Holy Spirit change Him or 
  did He remain just the same? Are there any hints that the Holy Ghost lay behind 
  the impressiveness of His personality? Can we appropriate some of the same power 
  that moved Jesus ?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>The Baptism of Jesus and His EQ</b></p>
<p>While Jesus grew in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man there 
  was also a sudden break in His life, a radical change in His emotions and personal 
  authority so that those who knew Him said &quot;where did He get this wisdom 
  from&#133;.&quot; </p>
<p>(Matthew 13:54-58 NKJV) And when He had come to His own country, He taught 
  them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished and said, &quot;Where 
  did this Man get this wisdom and these mighty works? {55} &quot;Is this not 
  the carpenter's son? Is not His mother called Mary? And His brothers James, 
  Joses, Simon, and Judas? {56} &quot;And His sisters, are they not all with us? 
  Where then did this Man get all these things?&quot; {57} So they were offended 
  at Him. But Jesus said to them, &quot;A prophet is not without honor except 
  in his own country and in his own house.&quot; {58} Now He did not do many mighty 
  works there because of their unbelief.</p>
<p>He had changed! While Luke shows us that Jesus was a child prodigy (Luke 2:42-50) 
  no-one expected Him to turn into a miracle working prophet. The transition from 
  promising youth to powerful prophet seems to have come at His baptism. There 
  was a massive empowering work of the Holy Spirit that changed Jesus just as 
  Pentecost changed the disciples. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The highest level EQ skills such as boldness and courage and skill in healing 
  and proclamation are Holy Spirit endowed. The early church realized this when 
  they prayed for boldness and the room shook! (Acts 4:29-31). EQ change empowered 
  by the Holy Spirit can be remarkable and sudden and leave others astonished. 
  I can testify personally to a remarkable change in one meeting in September 
  1978 when I went from being a timid and secretive Christian to being as bold 
  as a lion and an ardent evangelist!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>The Body of Jesus and The Holy Spirit</b></p>
<p>As we all know our physical state and our emotional state are closely connected. 
  We are more disposed to get angry when we are tired or hungry. We also seem 
  to inherit certain emotional dispositions from our parents. We are &quot;hard-wired&quot; 
  from birth into a certain emotional disposition (however this can later be altered 
  as we shall see). This can be as toxic as a problem with rage or as beneficial 
  as the ability to be enraptured by music. The Holy Spirit set Jesus' genetic 
  structure at conception so that He was unusually inclined to love righteousness 
  and hate wickedness (Hebrews 1:9). A passage from Hebrews indicates that His 
  body was prepared for him by God, so that Jesus would love to do the will of 
  God. (emphasis mine)</p>
<p>(Hebrews 10:5-7 NKJV) Therefore, when He came into the world, He said: &quot;Sacrifice 
  and offering You did not desire, But a body You have prepared for Me. {6} In 
  burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin You had no pleasure. {7} Then I said, 
  'Behold, I have come; In the volume of the book it is written of Me; To do Your 
  will, O God.'&quot;</p>
<p>Here we see that as Jesus came into the world He had a body prepared for Him 
  by the Father and the express intent of His coming into the world was &quot;to 
  do Your will O God..&quot; Jesus had a body that was free from sinful genetic 
  predispositions towards rage, alcoholism, drug addiction, or whatever other 
  negative traits that can be passed on genetically. Basically Jesus was born 
  without any sinful dispositions. His body and nervous system were formed to 
  do the will of God by the creative, body-renewing and forming work of the Holy 
  Spirit. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the creative work of the Holy Spirit was able to make Jesus&#146; body such 
  that it was free from sinful tendencies then obviously that power can go to 
  work in our bodies also. This gives us hope that long standing biological urges 
  can be erased by the healing and renewing ministry of the Holy Spirit and countless 
  Christian recovery programs attest that this is the case. Alcoholics can and 
  do lose the biological desire to drink, homosexuals can and do have their sexual 
  orientation set right, drug addicts can and do completely lose their cravings, 
  sex addicts can be and are freed from the torment of 24hr a day lust. But is 
  this a realistic and a scriptural expectation? Lets look at Romans 8:11</p>
<p>&#147;But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, 
  He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies 
  through His Spirit who dwells in you.&#148;</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit can give life to our mortal bodies &#150; not just our resurrection 
  bodies, but the very bodies we have now, our mortal bodies. His renewing life 
  can pulse through us and cleanse us from sins and addictions just as he can 
  heal a person from illness or disease. Like a divine electrician he can fix 
  the fuse box and rewire the house so the circuitry functions as it was always 
  meant to &#150; for the glory of God.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The biological basis of sin is not separate from the spiritual basis of sin. 
  When God delivers you from sin He can deliver you from sin in your spirit, sin 
  in your soul and eventually from the power of sin in your members. He can fix 
  the physical and medical basis of rage, lust, addictions and anti-social behaviour. 
  Minimal brain dysfunction, ADHD, post-traumatic stress disorder, and whatever 
  else may be engraved in our neural tissue - can be healed by the Holy Spirit. 
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lets see how this happened for the Christians at Corinth:</p>
<p>(1 Corinthians 6:9-11 NKJV) Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit 
  the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, 
  nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites, {10} nor thieves, nor covetous, 
  nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God. 
  {11} And such were some of you. But you were washed, but you were sanctified, 
  but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our 
  God.</p>
<p>The Corinthian Christians has come from some pretty terrible backgrounds including 
  fornication and adultery (sexual addiction), homosexuals and sodomites (probably 
  pedophiles in this case), and drunkards (alcoholics). These behaviors are generally 
  acknowledged to have a strong and persistent biological and neurological component. 
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>However they are now PAST behaviors, they have been repented of and forsaken 
  and the Corinthians are now washed and made holy! &quot;Such WERE some of you&quot; 
  - its over, dealt with, fixed. And this transformation took place &quot;in the 
  name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God&quot;. Paul puts it this 
  way&#133;.</p>
<p>(Romans 8:13 NKJV) For if you live according to the flesh you will die; but 
  if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.</p>
<p>(Galatians 5:16-18 NKJV) I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not 
  fulfill the lust of the flesh. {17} For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, 
  and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so 
  that you do not do the things that you wish. {18} But if you are led by the 
  Spirit, you are not under the law.</p>
<p>The Spirit can deal with the flesh in both its spiritual and biological aspects. 
  We are not at the mercy of our genetics or our addictions. The Holy Spirit can 
  set us free! What He did in constructing the body of Jesus so that it was prepared 
  to do God's will can be done for you as well &quot;for nothing is impossible 
  to him who believes&quot;.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>The Soul and Spirit of Jesus </b></p>
<p>Listed below are all the direct gospel references to the soul and spirit of 
  Jesus Christ. </p>
<p>(Matthew 26:38 NKJV) Then He said to them, &quot;My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, 
  even to death. Stay here and watch with Me.&quot;</p>
<p>(Matthew 27:50 NKJV) And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded 
  up His spirit.</p>
<p>(Mark 2:8 NKJV) But immediately, when Jesus perceived in His spirit that they 
  reasoned thus within themselves, He said to them, &quot;Why do you reason about 
  these things in your hearts?</p>
<p>(Mark 8:12 NKJV) But He sighed deeply in His spirit, and said, &quot;Why does 
  this generation seek a sign? Assuredly, I say to you, no sign shall be given 
  to this generation.&quot;</p>
<p>(Mark 14:34 NKJV) Then He said to them, &quot;My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, 
  even to death. Stay here and watch.&quot;</p>
<p>(Luke 10:21 NKJV) In that hour Jesus rejoiced in the Spirit and said, &quot;I 
  thank You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things 
  from the wise and prudent and revealed them to babes. Even so, Father, for so 
  it seemed good in Your sight.</p>
<p>(Luke 23:46 NIV) Jesus called out with a loud voice, &quot;Father, into your 
  hands I commit my spirit.&quot; When he had said this, he breathed his last.</p>
<p>(John 11:33 NKJV) Therefore, when Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came 
  with her weeping, He groaned in the spirit and was troubled.</p>
<p>(John 12:27 NKJV) &quot;Now My soul is troubled, and what shall I say? 'Father, 
  save Me from this hour'? But for this purpose I came to this hour.</p>
<p>(John 13:21 NKJV) When Jesus had said these things, He was troubled in spirit, 
  and testified and said, &quot;Most assuredly, I say to you, one of you will 
  betray Me.&quot;</p>
<p>(John 19:30 NIV) When he had received the drink, Jesus said, &quot;It is finished.&quot; 
  With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.</p>
<p>Three things especially stand out: </p>
<p>&Oslash; That Jesus perceived life's situations with His Spirit. </p>
<p>&Oslash; That Jesus was moved on the basis of those perceptions. </p>
<p>&Oslash; That Jesus candidly expressed His emotions to those closest to Him. 
</p>
<p>[Also to be noted are His ability to surrender His spirit to God and that with 
  the surrender of His spirit His life ended.]Note the power and depth of Jesus 
  reactions. He cries out with a loud voice, is troubled unto death, or rejoices 
  greatly. His Spirit-filled emotions were powerful and present. He is no antiseptic, 
  calm beyond belief, purely logical and mental being. The triumphs and tragedies 
  of faith move Him deeply indeed - as they have moved all great men and women 
  of God.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Jesus And Perception</b><br>
  In Mark 2:8 Jesus &quot;perceived in His spirit&quot;. The spirit is the true 
  organ for the perception of reality for Jesus as Isaiah declared in one of the 
  best known passages in the Bible:</p>
<p>(Isaiah 11:1-5 NKJV) There shall come forth a Rod from the stem of Jesse, And 
  a Branch shall grow out of his roots. {2} The Spirit of the LORD shall rest 
  upon Him, The Spirit of wisdom and understanding, The Spirit of counsel and 
  might, The Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD. {3} His delight 
  is in the fear of the LORD, And He shall not judge by the sight of His eyes, 
  Nor decide by the hearing of His ears; {4} But with righteousness He shall judge 
  the poor, And decide with equity for the meek of the earth; He shall strike 
  the earth with the rod of His mouth, And with the breath of His lips He shall 
  slay the wicked. {5} Righteousness shall be the belt of His loins, And faithfulness 
  the belt of His waist.</p>
<p>The presence of the Holy Spirit upon Jesus gave Him extraordinary knowledge 
  and wisdom so that He judged situations righteously and truthfully and inwardly. 
  He did not judge situations as they appeared to the eyes and ears and to sense 
  perception (verse 3 above). Rather He judged life's situations with a spirit 
  of wisdom and understanding, counsel and knowledge that saw into the heart of 
  things. This special perception that Jesus had shows in many of the gospel encounters 
  and is neatly summarized by the apostle John who writes: (John 2:24 NKJV) But 
  Jesus did not commit Himself to them, because He knew all men. ( see also Matthew 
  9:4, 12:25, Mark 5:30, 12:15 Luke 11;17, John 5:6, 6:61, 64 , 13:1-3, 18:4)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jesus' perceptions of situations then led to His emotional reactions to them. 
  On sensing His impending death His soul was troubled unto death, on seeing the 
  grief at Lazarus's tomb He groaned in spirit and was troubled, when the disciples 
  returned victorious He rejoiced, when He perceived the hardness of heart of 
  the Pharisees He became angry, and when He sees masses of people coming out 
  after healing and teaching He is moved with compassion. (see &quot;objection 
  3 in the previous chapter) . Jesus then expressed these emotions powerfully 
  but appropriately. There is always great dignity in the reactions of Jesus Christ. 
  His emotionality was deep and expressive - never trivial, sentimental or chaotic. 
  This then gives us a process for our own emotionality:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1. Perceive life spiritually, righteously, truthfully and with a Kingdom perspective.</p>
<p>2. React in our soul and spirit. Be moved by life. Not aloof and detached or 
  cold and hard.</p>
<p>3. Express those reactions with dignity, power and poise. Be full-hearted emotionally 
  but also be wise in expression.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the next chapter we will see that the apostles and many great men and women 
  of God over the centuries have done precisely this - bringing their emotions 
  under the control and empowerment of the Spirit of God so they reacted to things 
  no longer from a merely human perspective with its five senses and self-interest 
  but from a divine perspective with spiritual perception and true Kingdom interests. 
  This is what makes a good Christian biography so compelling - we sense a different 
  way of looking at the world - a heart controlled by God and seeing His interests 
  in all things. In that chapter I will argue that a Kingdom perspective is not 
  only good for our sanctification it is also critical for good emotional health 
  and a high EQ. However I have more to say about the emotional life of Jesus 
  first.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>The Beliefs of Jesus Christ</b></p>
<p>Emotions flow from beliefs. When I was a young boy I was playing by the local 
  creek when I found a huge lump of iron pyrites (Fool&#146;s Gold) and it was 
  heavy and soft and looked like gold. I showed my brother Peter and we went home 
  very secretively so nobody could see us with our important find. We then showed 
  Dad and said, &#147;We are rich! We are rich! We found this huge lump of gold 
  and there&#146;s more just down by the creek!&#148; Dad just laughed and explained 
  about Fool&#146;s Gold. Even though our belief was not a true belief it still 
  made us very happy while it lasted. We were so excited, not by actually finding 
  gold, because we didn&#146;t actually find gold, but by the belief that we had 
  found gold. When this belief was corrected, our emotion of joy was unsupported 
  by an adequate belief, and it vanished. We went from very excited to being a 
  bit disappointed. Once the belief vanished, the emotion vanished. Underneath 
  emotions are beliefs, if you take way the belief the emotion vanishes, if you 
  change the belief sufficiently, the emotion changes. </p>
<p>How we believe has a direct affect on how we feel. This applies even in spiritual 
  things. So if , like Jesus, you think that stealing houses from poor widows 
  is wrong, you will react to it with the intensity that Jesus did. The difference 
  between a video camera recording an event and a person seeing the event is that 
  the person has prior beliefs. These prior beliefs cause the person to react 
  to what they see. Lets look at three incidents in the life of Jesus to see how 
  His beliefs informed His emotional reactions and made them different from those 
  of so called &quot;normal people&quot;. First we will look at His cleansing 
  of the temple:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(Mark 11:15-17 NKJV) So they came to Jerusalem. Then Jesus went into the temple 
  and began to drive out those who bought and sold in the temple, and overturned 
  the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves. {16} 
  And He would not allow anyone to carry wares through the temple. {17} Then He 
  taught, saying to them, &quot;Is it not written, 'My house shall be called a 
  house of prayer for all nations'? But you have made it a 'den of thieves.'&quot;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(John 2:13-17 NKJV) Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went 
  up to Jerusalem. {14} And He found in the temple those who sold oxen and sheep 
  and doves, and the moneychangers doing business. {15} When He had made a whip 
  of cords, He drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and the oxen, 
  and poured out the changers' money and overturned the tables. {16} And He said 
  to those who sold doves, &quot;Take these things away! Do not make My Father's 
  house a house of merchandise!&quot; {17} Then His disciples remembered that 
  it was written, &quot;Zeal for Your house has eaten Me up.&quot;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What beliefs of Jesus lay behind the strength of His reaction here? In Mark's 
  gospel we see that Jesus believed :</p>
<p>a) That the purpose of the Temple was to be a house of prayer for all nations. 
</p>
<p>b) But that it had become a robbers den.</p>
<p> In John's gospel Jesus is shown believing that it is :</p>
<p>c) My Father's house </p>
<p>b) But instead it had become a house of merchandise (with the implication that 
  it was dishonest trade. </p>
<p>[The accounts are not contradictory they just report slightly different samples 
  of Jesus reactions at the time. It is probable that he said many other things 
  as well while He was overturning the tables.] </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lets look at the sequence of events. Jesus believes it should be A but perceives 
  it is in fact B this leads to emotional reaction C which is expressed in verbal 
  and physical behaviour D. For Jesus His beliefs included the honor due to His 
  Father , the fact that the right use of the temple was prayer and that all nations 
  should have access to it. They also included the belief that trade, especially 
  dishonest trade was inappropriate in such a location. These were not widely 
  and strongly held beliefs in His time otherwise the traders would not have been 
  there in the first place. His unique beliefs led to His unique emotional reaction 
  based on His spiritual perception of the nature of the situation. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lets move on and look at another of Jesus' puzzling reactions - during a fierce 
  storm on the lake of Galilee.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(Matthew 8:24-26 NKJV) And suddenly a great tempest arose on the sea, so that 
  the boat was covered with the waves. But He was asleep. {25} Then His disciples 
  came to Him and awoke Him, saying, &quot;Lord, save us! We are perishing!&quot; 
  {26} But He said to them, &quot;Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?&quot; 
  Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here Jesus' belief seems to have been that He was absolutely safe and that 
  nothing could touch Him because His Father was protecting Him and the disciples. 
  His belief also included the fact that it was a sane and reasonable thing for 
  Him to speak to waves and wind and expect that they would obey Him. Furthermore 
  He seems to believe that the disciples ought to share these beliefs and were 
  quite unjustified in being fearful in the midst of such a storm. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Based on these beliefs Jesus perception of the situation seems to have been 
  &quot;Not a problem!&quot;. It just wasn't a big deal. To say that this is &quot;counter-intuitive&quot; 
  and defies all common sense is no under-statement. Nevertheless his beliefs 
  were justified for He calmed the storm with a word. It truly wasn't a problem 
  for Him at all. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>People of great faith have a tremendous poise in crisis situations. In a later 
  chapter we shall learn how to handle situations we dread from a position of 
  faith and a sense of mastery. Here Jesus beliefs led to Him having emotions 
  of calm and a sense of mastery in a crisis situation and enabled Him to take 
  effective action to remedy the situation. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>For our third illustration of Jesus' belief system we will go a few verses 
  earlier in Matthew 8 to see the only time Jesus is recorded as &quot;marveling&quot; 
  at something&#133;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(Matthew 8:7-14 NKJV) And Jesus said to him, &quot;I will come and heal him.&quot; 
  {8} The centurion answered and said, &quot;Lord, I am not worthy that You should 
  come under my roof. But only speak a word, and my servant will be healed. {9} 
  &quot;For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say 
  to this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,' and he comes; and to 
  my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it.&quot; {10} When Jesus heard it, He marveled, 
  and said to those who followed, &quot;Assuredly, I say to you, I have not found 
  such great faith, not even in Israel! {11} &quot;And I say to you that many 
  will come from east and west, and sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in 
  the kingdom of heaven. {12} &quot;But the sons of the kingdom will be cast out 
  into outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&quot; {13} 
  Then Jesus said to the centurion, &quot;Go your way; and as you have believed, 
  so let it be done for you.&quot; And his servant was healed that same hour.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here Jesus is marveling at the &quot;great faith&quot; of the Roman centurion. 
  There are many beliefs of Jesus recorded here such as the hardness of Israel, 
  the salvation of the Gentiles and the power of His commands to heal the sick 
  but none of these beliefs are the mainstay of His marveling at the centurion. 
  Jesus is reacting to the presence of great faith in an unexpected place - a 
  Gentile and a soldier, a man who was outside of the covenant and whose job was 
  killing people and who was in part responsible for the occupation of His nation. 
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This was the reaction of one belief structure to another belief structure. 
  The centurion expressed His beliefs about a) his unworthiness as a Gentile (though 
  a powerful man) to have Jesus visit him and b) His belief in Jesus' authority 
  and the power of His words of command. As the centurion expressed these beliefs 
  Jesus in turn resonated with them. Just as the hardness of heart of the Pharisees 
  enraged Him, just as the littleness of faith of the disciples disappointed Him, 
  the great faith of the centurion encouraged and astonished Him. It was a &quot;rare 
  find&quot; &quot;Assuredly, I say to you, I have not found such great faith, 
  not even in Israel! . </p>
<p> </p>
<p>So we see that belief structures react to one another and evaluate one another. 
  When we find another who is astonishingly full of faith we rejoice. When we 
  find someone hard and cynical and unbelieving we are discouraged or angered. 
  Like Jesus we search out those that resonate with us. They are a rare find and 
  a treasure. The way we interact with others will depend in large measure on 
  what we believe about what they believe. Much inter-denominational misunderstanding 
  revolves around &quot;what we believe about what they believe&quot; and the 
  strong emotional reactions that result. It&#146;s a critical area for mental 
  health and is why some types of fundamentalism though very sound in many areas 
  are incredibly damaging psychologically.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Putting It All Together</b></p>
<p>Earlier we saw that perceptions led to internal emotions which were then expressed 
  appropriately. Later we have seen that our perceptions work in with our beliefs 
  to produce astonishing emotional reactions that are unique to the Christ-like 
  Spirit-filled believer. On top of this we have a physical predisposition to 
  certain types of emotional reactions and behaviours - covered in the first part 
  of this chapter. Thus we can say that for Jesus and the Spirit-filled believer 
  the steps are: 1. Perception of person or situation - ideally in the Spirit. 
  2. Interaction of perception with belief system. 3. Internal emotion generated. 
  4. Interaction of internal emotion with physical predisposition. 5. Expression 
  of emotion outwardly. </p>

<p>You may be wondering about the title of this chapter &quot;The Holy Spirit 
  And The Emotional Life of Jesus&quot; where is the Holy Spirit in Jesus&#146; 
  beliefs, perceptions etc. Lets see! </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b><i>Perception</i></b>: Jesus perceives by both His Spirit and the Holy Spirit 
  who brings these realities to Him. <br>
  <i><b>Beliefs: </b></i>The Holy Spirit writes the law of God on our minds and 
  hearts and forms our beliefs within us as our teacher and the One who shows 
  us the things that God has prepared for those who believe and reveals to us 
  the deep things of God. Here are just a few direct references to His teaching 
  ministry. (John 6:45, 14:26, Galatians 1;11,12 , 1 Corinthians 2:9-16, Ephesians 
  4:21, 1 Thessalonians 4:9, Hebrews 8;10-11, 1 John 2:20,27 ) <br>
  <i><b>Internal Emotions:</b></i> Emotions can proceed directly from our spirit 
  under the influence of the Holy Spirit &quot; and Jesus rejoiced in His spirit..&quot; 
  and emotions such as love, joy and peace are called the fruit of the Spirit 
  (Galatians 5:22,23). <br>
  <i><b>Interaction With Physical Disposition:</b></i> The indwelling Holy Spirit 
  gives life to our mortal bodies that we may be renewed and cry out &quot;Abba 
  Father!&quot; (Romans 8:11-15) to our gracious Heavenly Father. See also the 
  first section in this chapter on how His powerful work can break the domination 
  of our lives by sin and addictions. <br>
  <i><b>Outward Expression Of The Emotional Reaction:</b></i> The spiritual basis 
  for revelation that culminates in teaching is shown in 1 Corinthians. <br>
</p>
<p>(1 Corinthians 2:9-13 NKJV) But as it is written: &quot;Eye has not seen, nor 
  ear heard, Nor have entered into the heart of man The things which God has prepared 
  for those who love Him.&quot; {10} But God has revealed them to us through His 
  Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God. {11} 
  For what man knows the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is 
  in him? Even so no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God. {12} 
  Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from 
  God, that we might know the things that have been freely given to us by God. 
  {13} These things we also speak, not in words which man's wisdom teaches but 
  which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thus verse 13 is the culmination of a long sequence. Firstly truth which eye 
  cannot see and ear cannot hear is revealed to us through the Holy Spirit (verses 
  9-11). Then we receive them through the Holy Spirit who teaches us and works 
  them into our belief system. This is freely and graciously given (verse 12). 
  Finally we speak and we speak not human, but divine wisdom and not in human 
  words and categories but in words the Holy Spirit gives us. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thus Scripture is not just God's Word in human words; rather it is God's Word 
  in the Spirit's Words. Lets see how this worked for Jesus:</p>
<p>(John 8:28 NKJV) Then Jesus said to them, &quot;When you lift up the Son of 
  Man, then you will know that I am He, and that I do nothing of Myself; but as 
  My Father taught Me, I speak these things. {29} &quot;And He who sent Me is 
  with Me. The Father has not left Me alone, for I always do those things that 
  please Him .&quot;</p>
<p>The responses, reactions, words and expressions are taught to us by God and 
  are in spiritual categories &quot;comparing spiritual with spiritual.&#148;</p>
<p> </p>
<p> That leads on to the last section of this chapter - symbols, metaphors, and 
  archetypes - how the Spirit teaches us to express spiritual things - including 
  our emotions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>The Language Of The Spirit and The Emotional Realm - Symbols, Metaphors 
  and Archetypes.</b></p>
<p>As I am writing this &quot;Just As I Am&quot; is playing on the stereo in the 
  background and the choir is singing &quot;O Lamb Of God I come..&quot;. This 
  is the language of the Spirit that makes no sense to the carnal man but which 
  abounds in Scripture and in the great moments of the Christian faith including 
  the hymns that lift us to God. To take up where we left off in the passage1 
  Corinthians:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1 Corinthians 2:13-16 NKJV) These things we also speak, not in words which 
  man's wisdom teaches but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual 
  things with spiritual. {14} But the natural man does not receive the things 
  of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, 
  because they are spiritually discerned. {15} But he who is spiritual judges 
  all things, yet he himself is rightly judged by no one. {16} For &quot;who has 
  known the mind of the LORD that he may instruct Him?&quot; But we have the mind 
  of Christ.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There is something called &quot;the mind of Christ&quot; which enables the 
  believer to make sense of symbolic language such as &quot;the Lamb of God that 
  takes away the sin of the world&quot; and to quickly grasp the meaning of parables 
  and to feel the wonder of the scenes in Revelation. The Holy Spirit enables 
  us to perceive and believe correctly thus renewing our mind into the mind of 
  Christ . He is our Teacher and instructor and does so in the language of the 
  spiritual realm - dreams, visions, symbols, parables and metaphors - using analogues 
  of the faith to explain it as well as more straightforward language such as 
  that of the book of Romans. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the language of the Spirit beasts with seven heads and ten horns are juxtaposed 
  with scarlet women and numinous symbols such as the Throne of God. These can 
  be visual as well as verbal symbols and realities angels, demons, cherubim and 
  seraphim are seen by the seers and prophets. To the purely material and &quot;scientific&quot; 
  mind this is all quite offensive and many liberal theologians have stumbled 
  over it. The more we think of the power of our own intellect the less we think 
  of God's Word and the more we think of God's Word the less we think of the power 
  of our own intellect! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jesus was supremely taught of God and a master of the symbolic realm so the 
  He expressed Himself skillfully in parables, aphorisms, sermons and stories. 
  His teaching was unlike that of the scribes and Pharisees for He taught with 
  authority and in such a way that those truly seeking God understood Him while 
  those who were just curious walked away puzzled and frustrated with His teaching. 
  The language of the Spirit is not &quot;plain language&quot; but is strangely 
  numinous and symbolic. If you have seen some the &quot;New Age advertising&quot; 
  around that taps into these common and universal symbols of the emotional world 
  you will know what I mean. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>These symbols or archetypes such as a woman dressed in a flowing white robe 
  holding a torch aloft, or a dove against a clear blue sky, or a rainbow or a 
  man on a white horse dressed for war or a shining sword or a red dragon. These 
  symbols have universal emotional content almost independent of culture. The 
  psychologist Carl Jung spent His life exploring them and Hitler was a master 
  at exploiting them. Transpersonal psychology and various schools of psychoanalysis 
  take them very seriously indeed. Myth, saga, music, song and poetry all tap 
  into this treasure trove of emotional and spiritual symbols as do fables and 
  stories and most national anthems. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We interact with spiritual language either totally or not at all. The phrase 
  &quot;the Lamb of God&quot; either has immense meaning or is a total enigma. 
  It is an almost binary form of communication that literally &quot;separates 
  the sheep from the goats&quot; and believers from unbelievers. </p>
<p>(John 10:25-27 NKJV) Jesus answered them, &quot;I told you, and you do not 
  believe. The works that I do in My Father's name, they bear witness of Me. {26} 
  &quot;But you do not believe, because you are not of My sheep, as I said to 
  you. {27} &quot;My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me.</p>
<p>In a startling statement Jesus said &quot;but you do not believe because you 
  are not of my sheep&quot;. In other words you have to be one of God's people 
  to understand His teaching! It&#146;s the other side of the more usual &quot;because 
  you do not believe you are not God's&quot;. Here its &quot;because you are not 
  God's - you d o not believe.&quot; Some eagerly believe and can understand the 
  language of the Spirit while others are just further hardened by it. (John 12:40). 
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thus the spiritual person understand the things of the Spirit including symbols, 
  parables and dreams; is taught spiritual things by God, has a deep emotional 
  response to them which in turn finds its deepest expression in the language 
  of the Spirit speaking spiritual truths in words taught by God comparing spiritual 
  with spiritual. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>For Jesus and ideally for the Christ-like Spirit-filled believer the model 
  of the process for the development of the emotional life is as follows:</p>
<p>1. Things are perceived in and by the spirit by believers with the mind of 
  Christ and a lucid grasp of symbol and metaphor. These believers see life as 
  being in a Kingdom framework.</p>
<p>2. This perception is then passed through a grid of beliefs taught to the believer 
  by God.</p>
<p>3. This results in a godly internal emotional state in the believer - of rejoicing, 
  awe, wonder, repentance, burdens for the lost etc. </p>
<p>4. This is then mediated through the renewed life-filled temple of the Holy 
  Spirit that is the believers body and translated through his or her natural 
  God-given temperament.</p>
<p>5. Finally the emotional response is expressed in words taught by the Spirit 
  bringing edification to the body of Christ and reflecting the mind of Christ 
  on the matter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This should result in a deep, powerful resonant emotional life that is totally 
  in tune with Kingdom realities and which can express matters of justice and 
  truth as well as care and compassion. This Holy Spirit produced emotional life 
  should weep for the lost, ache for the poor and celebrate the repentance of 
  a single sinner. Like Jesus we should have a Holy Spirit given courage that 
  enables us to speak God&#146;s truth in God&#146;s words at God&#146;s moment. 
  Like Jesus the Holy Spirit in us should make us radiant with a healing and gracious 
  personality so that people sense the love and peace that is in us and know that 
  in our earthen vessels dwells a priceless treasure.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The next two chapters will test the above five step theory before we put it 
  into practice on ourselves. Firstly we will look at the emotional life of apostles, 
  prophets and great Christian leaders. Then we shall examine the dreadful emotional 
  life of carnal Christians. On the way we shall see if the model we have developed 
  works.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Discussion Questions</b><br>
  <br>
  1. What are the five steps in the five-step model?<br>
</p>
<p>2. What was special about the body of Jesus Christ?<br>
</p>
<p>3. What difference did the Holy Spirit make in the life of Jesus?<br>
</p>
<p>How did Jesus perceive reality differently from others <br>
</p>
<p>How did the beliefs of Jesus Christ affect or determine His behaviour? <br>
</p>
<p>How is symbolic language often quite different from the language we normally 
  use? Why is it useful ? </p>
