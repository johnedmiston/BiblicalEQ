<p> </p>
<p>Once we are in touch with our own emotions and the emotions of others we need 
  to put those feelings into words so that they touch minds and hearts and minister 
  the grace of Jesus Christ to the world. With Jesus as our model and some guidance 
  from the Wisdom literature of Scripture we will look at how to speak and act 
  with emotional understanding and appropriate expression.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Issues of Timing -There Is A Time </b></p>
<p>We are not free to just &#147;let fly&#148; with our emotions. According to 
  Scripture there is an appropriate time for each and every form of emotional 
  expression. This is not chronological time such as &#147;at 3 pm you may weep&#148; 
  but event time linked to life events and happenings &#147;at a funeral it is 
  a good time to express sympathy&#148;. An emotion &#147;out of time&#148; is 
  jarring and unedifying and may even be cruel. Laughter at a pastor&#146;s joke 
  is appropriate; laughter at a person&#146;s misfortune is not. Each expression 
  of emotion has its time and place. Each is &#147;beautiful in its time&#148; 
  (Eccl 3:11). Emotions in their time are truly of the Spirit and a blessing to 
  others.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Generally our emotions should be matched to those around us so we &#147;Rejoice 
  with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep.&#148; (Romans 12:15 ) 
  Emotions should be congruent in both type and intensity. For instance if people 
  are rejoicing loudly it is appropriate to rejoice loudly with them, if they 
  are weeping quietly it is appropriate to weep quietly in sympathy. When Mary 
  and Martha wept over Lazarus &#150; Jesus also wept. In times of deep suffering 
  and anguish silence can be the best counsel (Job 2:13). Culture, circumstances 
  and social dynamics normally tell us what emotional expression is appropriate 
  in any given situation but this can be modified by the Holy spirit from time 
  to time. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>People who get the social timing of emotional expression wrong can quickly 
  become social outcasts. The classic comic figure is someone who always makes 
  a mess of things in social situations. At the other extreme are people who always 
  blend in perfectly. Such people may lack authenticity and become false and hypocritical, 
  weakened morally by over-compliance with the norm. The &#147;time to speak&#148; 
  is dictated ultimately by the Holy Spirit not social convention (though such 
  conventions are useful and we should know them). Jesus and the prophets often 
  seemed to be &#147;speaking out of turn&#148; in setting forth God&#146;s message 
  to their time and place. Others such as Ezra and Daniel seemed to fit much more 
  closely into the warp and woof of their social situations. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>However God calls us to speak we should remember that it is His interests we 
  are serving with our every word and every expression of emotion. Our communication 
  is to flow from the Spirit and be for the edification of others. It is not our 
  own interests we serve or our own need for expressing ourselves. Ultimately 
  love of God and love of neighbour should govern the expression and timing of 
  our emotions. Lets look at a few Scriptural guidelines on how we can do this.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Issues of Intensity - Being Strong With The Strong And Weak With The Weak</b></p>
<p>We need to match our emotional expression with the strength of the person and 
  the depth of the spiritual needs of those around us. When Jesus spoke to people 
  who strong, hard and stubborn he was strong and harsh and direct (Matthew 23:1-10). 
  On the other hand with the broken and hurting he was so gentle that it could 
  be said of Him &#147; a bruised reed He will not break&#148; (Isaiah 42:3). 
  Paul makes the puzzling statement &#147;with the weak I became weak&#148; (1 
  Corinthians 9:22). This means that Paul did not overwhelm weak souls with his 
  powerful personality. Instead Paul measured the strength of his reactions to 
  what the person needed and could take. Paul also tells us to &#147;uphold the 
  weak and be patient with all&#148; (1 Thessalonians 5:14) and that no-one was 
  weak without him becoming weak (2 Corinthians 11:29). On the other hand when 
  Peter was in error this same Paul &#147;withstood him to his face&#148; (Galatians 
  2:11). The revivalist Charles Finney used to classify sinners into &#147;hardened&#148;, 
  &#147;awakened&#148; and &#147;penitent&#148; each requiring a different approach 
  from the evangelist.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We see a good example of this principle early on in the book of 1 Samuel when 
  Hannah is weeping before the Lord (1 Samuel 1:9-18). Eli the high priest at 
  first sternly rebuked Hannah thinking she was drunk. It was a &#147;strong&#148; 
  response &#150; and in this case it was inappropriate. On realising that Hannah 
  was pouring out her soul before the Lord Eli changed from a &#147;strong&#148; 
  to a &#147;weak&#148; or gentle response. He became conciliatory and replied 
  &#147;may the Lord grant your petition&#148;. In doing this Eli adjusted his 
  emotional expression to suit the spiritual needs of the situation. Eli was big 
  enough to admit his mistake and adjust his response. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are to be both priest and prophet. Is the person strong and hard and do 
  they need to be brought to repentance? Then be strong and speak like a prophet. 
  Are they troubled in soul like Hannah - then minister grace like a priest. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Issues of Place - Private and Public Emotion</b></p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 14 Paul writes about the use of the gift of tongues saying 
  that private tongues were for private moments and not for the general worship 
  service. This established the principle that only things that are edifying to 
  the church as a whole should be brought into the public domain. Private spiritual 
  and emotional experiences may be very helpful to the person in private &#150; 
  but they are not for general public consumption. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In church life we have different levels of sharing, that which we share with 
  God alone, and that which we share without our family and close friends, that 
  which share with a cell group and that which will share with the general public. 
  As a rule of thumb the higher the level of emotion the more private the sharing 
  should be. Emotional sharing is restricted to where it can safely edify the 
  people who hear. Even between Jesus and the disciples at the Last Supper Jesus 
  said &quot;I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them 
  now.&#148; (John 16:12) He limited His most intimate sharing to what the disciples 
  could cope with and be edified by. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The principle of &#147;for the edification of all&#148; needs to be carefully 
  weighed up when there is sharing of intimate personal testimonies, or the use 
  of the prophetic and the visionary and even during times of passionate intercessory 
  prayer in a known language. I know a woman who is a powerful and prophetic intercessor 
  who groans and travails before God. Unfortunately her private travail, her pain, 
  her anger, and her righteous indignation are voiced with such deep intensity 
  in the evening service that people are not edified but only embarrassed. This 
  has caused many to leave that service or even find another church. It is the 
  right emotion in the wrong place. While it is deeply sincere and not sinful 
  as such, it is simply not edifying or helpful. Her emotional outpouring that 
  has its place before the throne of God in private is out of place in a general 
  worship service. Powerful private emotions, even when they are holy emotions, 
  are not for general public consumption. Lets see how even Jesus and the apostles 
  observed this rule.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Much to the frustration of bible scholars and students of prayer, Jesus never 
  revealed publicly the nature of His private prayer times with the Father. Neither 
  did He reveal to His disciples much about His dreams and visions or describe 
  in any detail His experience of the spiritual world. Also Paul was very reticent 
  in describing what was probably his most powerful spiritual experience in 2 
  Corinthians 12. Scholars still debate whether this was Paul&#146;s experience 
  or that of someone he knew. If Jesus and Paul and the apostles were highly reticent 
  to speak about their private spiritual experiences and if countless great men 
  and women of God since have shared their reticence perhaps we should be very 
  careful about expressing these sorts of things in public. I am especially careful 
  about the expression of private dreams and visions or the numerous accounts 
  of trips to Heaven or Hell. In Colossians Paul sternly warns Christians about 
  people who take their stand on visions they have seen and depart from the Head, 
  which is Christ (Colossians 2:18,19).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The exception to this is in small groups where intimacy has developed over 
  time and permission for deep sharing is an understood part of the group dynamics. 
  Those who followed David in the wilderness, the 12 disciples of Jesus and the 
  various missionary companions of Paul are Scriptural examples of small groups 
  that seemed to have lived and shared at a very deep level. Cell groups, bible 
  studies and 12 Step groups are all places where sharing and emotional expression 
  can go deeper for Christians. We all need outlets for our deep emotions and 
  while friends and family should provide this, often they do not do it very well 
  so some alternative structures need to be created. If our private world fails 
  us we cannot just take our overwhelming emotions public. They need to be shared 
  in private with a counsellor, a therapy group or a small group that will willingly 
  accept emotions at that level and keep them in confidence. It is simply not 
  safe to share yourself in public with a fallen world, which is not committed 
  to respecting you and your privacy. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>How can we know what is appropriate expression of emotions and spiritual experiences? 
  Firstly we need to ask does it match the emotional tone and volume of the group. 
  Is the sharing much more intense than what other people are sharing? Is it much 
  &#147;deeper&#148; than the group normally copes with? Is it in a tone of voice 
  that is much louder and strident than the other sharing? Is it about matters 
  that other people cannot cope with or have no personal experience of? Are people 
  looking awkward and embarrassed? Are you expecting people who hardly know you 
  to act as family or close friends, or even to be therapeutic for you? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Secondly we need to ask if God meant us to share it in the first place. With 
  some visions God told people to &#147;seal up the scroll&#148;, and yet others 
  were to be announced. When the seven thunders spoke the apostle John was not 
  allowed to write down what they said. (Revelation 10:3,4) but to Ezekiel God 
  said, &quot;Son of man, eat what you find; eat this scroll, and go, speak to 
  the house of Israel.&quot; (Ezekiel 3:1). We need permission from God to share 
  our dreams and visions and without that permission the general rule should be 
  to keep quiet and wait on God for His timing for that revelation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thirdly we need to spiritually evaluate that which we think the Lord has told 
  us to share especially if it has a high emotional content. Often the best thing 
  to do is to carefully write down exactly what you think God wants you to say 
  &#150; just as the prophets wrote down their revelations. Then wait on it in 
  prayer for at least 48 hours. The finally share it with two or three others 
  that you trust and who can help you if you have accidentally said something 
  that is not quite in line with Scripture. Many churches have the policy that 
  all prophecy should be passed by the elders before being aired in public and 
  this seems to prevent much abuse of the prophetic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fourthly we need to be careful about the presence of young people and those 
  with more sensitive and impressionable dispositions. Some horrifying sermon 
  illustrations (especially one about a father letting his son be killed in a 
  swing bridge to save a passing train) are so emotional that they can only be 
  described as manipulative. These can scare young people in the congregation 
  leaving them with distorted views of God and church. Sermons need to be G-rated 
  when children are present.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fifthly ministers need to be extremely careful about sharing intimate or sensational 
  information, especially that of a sexual nature, from the pulpit. There are 
  certain lines we need to draw when dealing with social evils and Paul refuses 
  to comment about certain gross perversions that &#147;should not even be mentioned 
  among the saints&#148; (1 Corinthians 5:1, Ephesians 5:3). Sensational and vivid 
  material is seldom edifying unless it is masterfully handled. It tends to spark 
  unhealthy associations, start rumours, and lead to idle curiosity or inform 
  people about things they are better off being ignorant about. Confessions in 
  particular should only be made to God alone or to highly trusted and confidential 
  others. If some details have to go public because of the public nature of the 
  offence they should be kept to an edifying minimum.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Finally deep emotions should only be shared when there is genuine trust already 
  present &#150; not to elicit trust or as an act of manipulation. Some clever 
  people share their emotions in a way that gets people in. They use emotional 
  sharing to build trust &#150; which they later violate. Proper emotional sharing 
  is built on pre-existing trust and is not a tool to manipulate others with.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once we have the timing of our emotional expression right and decided on how 
  private or public it is to be we then need to make sure that we deliver a clear, 
  unambiguous and balanced message.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Issues of Balance &#150; Ensuring You Get Both Parts Of Your Message Across</b><br>
  Emotions are often mixed and in order to express them clearly we need to give 
  a picture of all the emotions involved in a particular situation and their relative 
  strengths. For instance consider a Christian father watching his daughter go 
  out on her first date with a godly young man from the church youth group. He 
  may say something like:</p>
<p> &#147;Jill, Steven is a good choice and I am pleased that you have chosen 
  to go out with him and not some other guy. He is a guy of real character and 
  I am sure he will treat you well. However that skirt you have chosen is a bit 
  too daring. I know it is your first date and you want to be attractive but I 
  want you to change it right now. I also want you back here by 10:00 pm and no 
  later. That will make sure that your Mum and I can feel that you have a responsible 
  attitude to dating and we can trust you in the future. Have a good night and 
  have fun and don&#146;t forget to pray. I hope you enjoy the movie it sure sounds 
  good.&#148; </p>
<p>Here the father is expressing a wide range of concerns each in balance with 
  the others giving a coherent message. The anxiety is not out of balance with 
  the love and the clear rules are set in a general context of approval, care 
  and concern. This is what I call the &#147;light and shadow&#148; technique. 
  It involves expressing all aspects of an issue, its boundaries, the light and 
  the dark and the various contrasts so it cannot fail to be understood. </p>
<p>Often I use the phrases &#147;I am saying&#148; and &#147;I am not saying..&#148; 
  e.g. &#147;I am saying you need to redo that work, but I am not saying that 
  you are a bad employee. I continue to value your services.&#148; By giving the 
  contrasts, by clearly stating what you are saying and what you are not saying, 
  the message is made completely clear and misunderstanding is removed. The concerned 
  father in the illustration above may have just said &#147;You are not going 
  out in that skirt.&#148; without any further explanation. If he had done so 
  the daughter may have leaped to a range of rather dramatic and negative conclusions. 
  By including the reassurances, and placing things in context, potential misunderstanding 
  and conflict was avoided. Paul often uses this technique in his epistles where 
  he reassures the church of his prayers, love and concern and then firmly corrects 
  a wide range of issues. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This use of the &#147;light and shadow&#148; technique takes a while to master. 
  First of all you have to know the main fears of the other person and then you 
  have to possess the courage to address them directly. For instance in getting 
  someone to do some very sub-standard work again you might say &#147;This work 
  is well below your best George and I&#146;m disappointed the you produced it. 
  You are in no danger of being fired but I very much want you to lift your game 
  and to do this over again. I value your work and I think highly of the contributions 
  you have made in the past but this is just not good enough. I am sure you will 
  do a better job this time around.&#148; The obvious fears of dismissal and of 
  being thought incompetent are addressed and reassurance given. At the same time 
  the message that it is not good enough is clearly and firmly conveyed. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This raises one of the trickiest questions in human communication &#150; how 
  much emotional truth can we tell in a given situation? We may have the timing 
  right, the choice of audience (private or public) correct, a balanced and tactful 
  statement but how much do we tell people about the emotional truth of the situation?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Issues of Emotional Truth &#150; Why Not Fake It Till We Make It?</b><br>
  Is not some pretence a normal and even an essential part of life? What about 
  people who are in constrained social roles such as an archbishop or mayor where 
  a high degree of emotional control is required? Do you really want an emotionally 
  honest policeman during a crisis? Aren&#146;t we supposed to be joyful, so what&#146;s 
  so wrong about faking a bit of enthusiasm?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Christians do not express emotions for mere impression management, or for personal 
  catharsis under the guise of authenticity. Emotions are expressed for the glory 
  of God, for the edification of His people and or the love of one&#146;s neighbour. 
  Thus a policeman in a crisis will not vent his or her feelings but maintain 
  good emotional control and a professional demeanour as that is the right, loving 
  and most edifying course of action in a crisis. Contrary to some pop psychology 
  books this is not repression. It is in fact responsible Christian emotional 
  management. It is not pretence; it is self-control.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pretence is when you pretend to be experiencing an emotion that you do not 
  really have within you. Self-control is when you bring a real and existing emotion 
  into line with God&#146;s will. Faking it till we make it tends only to produce 
  good actors and skilful hypocrites. False emotion ends up deluding people and 
  eroding our morality. We cannot lie about our emotional state without lying 
  about ourselves and the danger is coming to believe the lie and losing touch 
  with ourselves forever. On the other hand should we not be so in love with &#147;total 
  sincerity&#148; that we answer the question &#147;how are you?&#148; with a 
  list of woes and complaints! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our emotions should be true and not false but they should also be appropriate 
  and edifying. We are to express true emotions that are modulated by the circumstances, 
  timing and needs of the situation. We think before we emote. We aim to edify, 
  to be appropriate, to inject those feelings into the situation that encourage, 
  uplift or console. We balance truth with grace, bringing both to bear on the 
  situation. Jesus did not retreat from expressing emotion, His emotions were 
  real and authentic and spiritual. There was a solid and appropriate truth about 
  them. Yet they conveyed grace and fitted the moment perfectly. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thus we should never fake an emotion except if you are actually an actor. Christian 
  emotion is to be real, but it is also to be self-controlled. The emotion revealed 
  should fit the circumstances, and it should edify others. If I am boiling mad 
  nothing is gained by &#147;being honest&#148;. I am far better off maintaining 
  self-control. But neither should I fake happiness in order to disguise my anger. 
  That ends up being self-distorting and untruthful. God is self-revealing but 
  He is also self-concealing! He reveals the truth about Himself, a bit at a time, 
  as we can manage and cope with. He does not reveal all of Himself at once. Similarly, 
  we need to reveal the truth about ourselves, so we cannot pretend emotionally, 
  but we need to fit that truth to what others can bear. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>In this chapter we have seen that there is a proper time for very emotion and 
  that this is an &#147;event time&#148; not a clock time. We also saw that emotions 
  have a proper intensity that depends on the person &#150; being strong with 
  the strong and weak with the weak. Emotions they have their proper audiences 
  and private emotions belong in private. We have also seen a little on how to 
  balance emotions in our speech and how to express them wisely and truthfully 
  for the glory of God and the edification of others. Much more about appropriate 
  emotional expression can be learned by observing people of integrity in your 
  own culture and surroundings. Watch how they handle situations and how the delicate 
  balances are achieved, what is said and what is left out, how they encourage 
  and how they rebuke and how they carry the image of Jesus in their behavior. 
  The final chapter will be about love. After all is not that what we are aiming 
  at as we express our emotions?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Discussion Questions</b><br>
  <br>
  1. Read Ecclesiastes 3:1-11, what does it tell you about the timing of emotional 
  expression?<br>
</p>
<p>2. How forceful should we be with people? What does it mean to be strong with 
  the strong and weak with the weak? Have you ever been in a situation like Eli 
  where you have realized that you have needed to change your approach? <br>
</p>
<p>3. How openly can we share our emotions? Which emotions are best kept private? 
  <br>
</p>
<p>4. &#147;Let everything be done for the edification of others.&#148; How does 
  this principle affect the way we communicate personally? How does the principle 
  affect how we should communicate in church? <br>
</p>
<p>5. List some ways in which misunderstandings can cause big problems. How can 
  using the &#147;light and shadow technique&#148; help avoid this? Use the light 
  and shadow technique as you tackle the following problem &#147;Some good natured 
  but rather active teenagers sit down the back of the church, nudge each other 
  and are a bit playful during services though not in a bad way. Some of the crusty 
  members of the church are affronted by this and have come demanding that something 
  be done. You need to say something to both groups here. What do you say and 
  how do you say it? <br>
</p>
<p>6. Should we fake it till we make it? Why not? <br>
