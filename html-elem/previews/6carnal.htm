<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><b><font color="#006666">(1 Corinthians 3:1-5 NKJV) 
  And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual people but as to carnal, 
  as to babes in Christ. {2} I fed you with milk and not with solid food; for 
  until now you were not able to receive it, and even now you are still not able; 
  {3} for you are still carnal. For where there are envy, strife, and divisions 
  among you, are you not carnal and behaving like mere men? {4} For when one says, 
  &quot;I am of Paul,&quot; and another, &quot;I am of Apollos,&quot; are you 
  not carnal?</font></b></font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We just saw how the five-step model of emotions quite accurately predicted 
  the emotional life of Spirit-filled men and women of God. Now the model has 
  as its central theme that emotional maturity is arrived at by focusing on Jesus, 
  and modeling our emotions after Him in the power of the Holy Spirit. It is the 
  Holy Spirit who renews our perceptions, beliefs, emotions, and physical bodies 
  and who gives us wisdom in how to express our emotions in ways that are &#147;taught 
  of God&#148;. We saw a positive correlation between what the theory predicted 
  about the great saints of God, who cooperated with the Holy Spirit, and how 
  they turned out emotionally, becoming beings of emotional grandeur. If our model 
  stands the test, then those who resist the Holy Spirit, those who are unspiritual, 
  should not be beings of emotional grandeur. Rather they should be emotionally 
  unformed and immature. If, as our theory predicts, the Holy Spirit is essential 
  for full emotional formation, then unspiritual Christians should be emotional 
  wrecks, or at the least quite shallow and indifferent emotionally. These unspiritual 
  Christians are termed &#147;carnal Christians&#148; and this chapter will see 
  if our model can predict how they will turn out and what lessons we can learn 
  from that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The carnal Christian is characterized by an astonishing lack of spiritual maturity 
  to the point where they cannot be addressed as spiritual people. Carnal Christians 
  behave like &quot;mere men&quot; and are indistinguishable from the surrounding 
  culture with their actions and reactions. Using our model we can again make 
  certain predictions about the emotional life of those who do not give the Holy 
  Spirit full lordship of their lives. We will just reverse the predictions in 
  the previous chapter. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><b>Perception</b></i></p>
<p>1. They will see the world in much the same terms as the surrounding culture. 
  For them the Kingdom perspective will be rare and they will be mainly self-centred.</p>
<p>2. They will be unable to see into the hearts of men and women and even empathy 
  will be rare. They will not speak accurately to the human condition.</p>
<p>3. They will be baffled by dreams, visions and symbolic language. They will 
  be bored by the prophetic and struggle with the Scriptures.</p>
<p><b><i>Beliefs</i></b></p>
<p>4. They will mainly have beliefs that the surrounding culture has taught them. 
  They will not hold beliefs that the culture opposes vehemently, and will have 
  few beliefs that only God could have taught them.</p>
<p>5. They will have a very weak sense of what is righteous and what is unrighteous 
  and rarely react to social evil. They would tolerate the selling of doves in 
  the Temple. Zeal will be unusual for them and even undesirable. They will not 
  be consumed by kingdom interests. </p>
<p>6. They will not have unusual poise and power in crisis situations like Jesus 
  in the storm but rather will be prone to anxiety.</p>
<p>7. They will not resonate with and be emotionally drawn to those who are of 
  great faith. Rather they will feel more at home with the world and with other 
  carnal Christians. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b><i>Emotions</i></b></p>
<p>8. They will not have deep, vivid and stable emotions like those of Jesus Christ. 
  They will instead be characterised by shallow sentimental spiritual feelings 
  that vary with every wind of doctrine.</p>
<p>9. They will have little sense of their emotions being God's emotions. They 
  will often be unaware of what they are feeling and will be unable to name their 
  emotions clearly. They will not be people of authentic emotional expression.</p>
<p><b><i>Physical Nature</i></b></p>
<p>10. They will not demonstrate victory over addictions and sexual temptations 
  They will fail to express their emotions in godly ways through their physical 
  bodies.</p>
<p><b><i>Emotional Expression</i></b></p>
<p>11. Their spiritual emotions will rarely lead to righteous actions. Compassion 
  for the lost or the poor will rarely be felt and will not move them to action. 
  Their emotionality will be detached from real life and be like the emotions 
  of an actor or a hypocrite.</p>
<p>12. The course of their lives will not demonstrate an ever-increasing wisdom 
  in emotional expression. They will go from bad to worse and become increasingly 
  discordant like &quot; a clanging gong and a clashing cymbal&quot; if they should 
  continue as carnal Christians.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>How does this tally with your experience of carnal Christians? Unfortunately 
  it tallies very closely with my experience of them! They are not growing and 
  in fact they are often going backwards spiritually. Lets see what the New Testament 
  says about them. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the quote that opened this chapter we find Paul referring to the church 
  in 1 Corinthians as &#147;carnal&#148; &#150; well what was it like? The carnality 
  of the church is reflected in a long list of very serious sins &#150; the first 
  four chapters detail division, intellectual and spiritual pride, factions, and 
  infighting. Chapters five and six show they were visiting prostitutes, and engaging 
  in sexual immorality, and incest, chapter seven discusses marriage, divorce 
  and the basics of sexually appropriate behavior, chapters eight to eleven correct 
  gross disorder such as being drunk at the Lord's Supper, not waiting for one 
  another so one goes hungry while another is full, and participation in feasts 
  in pagan temples and eating food sacrificed to idols. Chapters 12- 14 reveal 
  a paganisation of the spiritual gifts and their use in competitive, unloving 
  and chaotic ways. Chapter 15 finds them denying the resurrection and being in 
  major error over basic doctrines. The church was a mess but it was still considered 
  a Christian church. The church James wrote to may have even been worse! There 
  they murdered one another (James 4:2) and treated the poor with contempt (James 
  2). Both these churches were considered Christian churches and the recipients 
  were addressed as believers and referred to as saints or holy ones (1 Corinthians 
  1:2). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Several epistles are addressed to churches with a good percentage of carnal 
  Christians these are : Galatians, 1 &amp; 2 Corinthians , Titus, Hebrews and 
  James. In these epistles the language is extremely plain and there are many 
  stern warnings about the consequences of sin and the judgment of God. (e.g. 
  Galatians 5, Hebrews 6, 1 Corinthians 5, 2 Corinthians 12 &amp; 13 etc). In 
  the first six or so chapters of his epistle the writer to the Hebrews calls 
  his audience in various turns - sluggish, unfruitful, dull of hearing, immature, 
  like children, and says they were neglectful of their salvation, in danger of 
  drifting away from the faith and hardening their hearts to God's Word and on 
  the point of having &quot;evil, unbelieving, hearts&quot; (Heb 3:12). In chapter 
  10 the writer goes on to say they are neglecting meeting together and on the 
  verge of giving up the faith, returning to sin and being judged by the living 
  God. This is a terrifying picture indeed! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Carnal Christians are so close to being unbelievers that they are almost indistinguishable 
  from them. Such Christians are characterised by apathy, division, ongoing strife 
  and a very low EQ! Carnal Christians &quot;bite and devour one another&quot; 
  (Galatians 5:15) The carnal Christians needed lengthy instructions on the basics 
  of human relationships and fortunately the apostolic response to this need has 
  given rise to some of the finest literature on relationships in the world including 
  the famous &quot;love chapter&quot; in 1 Corinthians 13. This is in direct contrast 
  with other more Spirit-filled churches like the one at Thessalonica of whom 
  Paul said :&quot; (1 Thessalonians 4:9 NKJV) But concerning brotherly love you 
  have no need that I should write to you, for you yourselves are taught by God 
  to love one another;.&quot;.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Where Then Is The Holy Spirit?</b></p>
<p>All truly born-again Christians receive the Holy Spirit as part of the dynamics 
  of conversion and the formation of the new man in them, which is Christ in them 
  the hope of glory. So all these Christians in Corinth, called &#145;saints&#148; 
  by Paul, presumably had the Holy Spirit. Yet they were a mess. Something was 
  dreadfully wrong. There seems to be a breakdown along the way. Their sanctification 
  was falling to bits; it just wasn&#146;t working. The Holy Spirit in them was 
  not producing maturity, the fruit of the Spirit were not evident. Was this God&#146;s 
  fault? Had God given up on them? Surely not! These people were doing something 
  that was stopping the Holy Spirit from having His way in their lives. They were 
  sinning against the Spirit&#146;s presence in their lives.</p>
<p>This raises the question what then happens to the Holy Spirit in born-again 
  Christians who have become carnal? In tribal cultures they often think that 
  the Holy Spirit vanishes from you if you sin. That is not New Testament teaching. 
  The Holy Spirit remains within the believer but is sinned against. Several terms 
  are used such as: Grieved (Ephesians 4:30), quenched (1 Thessalonians 5:19) 
  lied to (Acts 5:4), put to the test (Acts 5:9), insulted / outraged (Hebrews 
  10:29), made jealous (James 4:5), blasphemed (Matthew 12:31) and resisted (Acts 
  7:51). In Jude the divisive people are said to be &quot;devoid of the Spirit&quot; 
  (Jude 1:19). We will very briefly look at each of these terms to gain some understanding 
  of the spiritual dynamics of sinning against the Holy Spirit and its effects 
  on the emotional life. </p>
<p><i>Grieved </i>(Ephesians 4:30) - by unnecessary and immature interpersonal 
  conflict such as bitterness, wrath, slander and malice. The Spirit is a Spirit 
  of love and is grieved by that which is opposed to love. Carnal behavior such 
  as divisiveness and quarreling is anti-love, and causes grief to the Holy Spirit 
  who is constantly trying to mature us in love. </p>
<p><i>Quenched</i> (1 Thessalonians 5:18-21) - by despising the gifts of the Spirit 
  especially prophesy. It implies that his fire - His inspirational activity in 
  prophecy and revival is resisted - perhaps in the name of order, and &quot;cold 
  water&quot; is thrown on attempts to minister in spiritual power.</p>
<p><i>Lied To</i> (Acts 5:4): Ananias and Sapphira conspired in an act of financial 
  deception of the apostles. This was seen as not deceiving men but God and lying 
  to the Holy Spirit. (Acts 5:4) and resulted in them being carried out dead. 
</p>
<p><i>Put To The Test </i>(Acts 5:9): Again refers to Ananias and Sapphira and 
  refers to their testing the omniscience of the Holy Spirit by thinking they 
  could deceive those He had filled with power and anointed. </p>
<p><i>Made Jealous </i>(James 4:4,5):Adulterers and adulteresses! Do you not know 
  that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever therefore wants to 
  be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. Or do you think that 
  the Scripture says in vain, &quot;The Spirit who dwells in us yearns jealously&quot;? 
  A difficult verse to translate. Refers to friendship with the world, which is 
  seen as spiritual adultery and makes the Spirit jealous. The world system and 
  the Kingdom are opposites. To love one is to make the other jealous and if we 
  love the world (as in worldliness, not as in John 3:16) we enrage the Holy Spirit. 
  Worldliness is often characteristic of carnal Christians and does great damage 
  to their relationship with God.</p>
<p><i>Insulted/Outraged/Do Despite Unto</i> (Hebrews 10:29): Refers to someone 
  who turns back from Christianity to Judaism (or to any other religion) and thus 
  says that the work of the Spirit of grace in his or her life was of no value 
  to them. These are apostates.</p>
<p><i>Devoid Of The Spirit </i>(Jude 1:19): Refers to false teachers who joined 
  into Christian groups and created division leading people away to their own 
  groups. These are probably not even believers to start with.</p>
<p><i>Resisted</i> (Acts 7:51): Refers to the unbelieving Jews who were stoning 
  Stephen and resisting the clear testimony of the Holy Spirit. Later God said 
  to one of those resistant Jews &quot;Saul, Saul, it must be hard for you to 
  kick against the goads..&quot;. This term is not used of believers.</p>
<p><i>Blasphemed </i>(Matthew 12:31): Is used of those unbelieving Jews who so 
  deeply resisted the Holy Spirit that they saw the miraculous ministry of Jesus 
  Christ as the work of the Devil and attributed His power to Satan. Again it 
  is never used of Christians.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The emotional consequences of sinning against the Holy Spirit are dire indeed. 
  The more people sin against the Holy Spirit the nastier they become. In the 
  above verses we see them pilfering, murdering lying, fighting and quarreling. 
  As the Holy Spirit is quenched, grieved and resisted His love departs and hatred 
  enters in. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>How does this come about? A love of worldly things, a growing resentment , 
  anger and malice, a dislike of prophecy and revivals, a little dishonesty with 
  finances here and there and after a while the activity of the Holy Spirit in 
  the believers life is reduced to a whisper and as they head out the back door 
  of the faith they deliver the final insult by rejecting the value of Jesus whom 
  the Spirit bears witness to.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In answer to our question, &#147;What is the relationship between the Holy 
  Spirit and the carnal Christian?&#148; the relationship is one of struggle and 
  pain. The Spirit is grieved, made jealous, quenched and resisted. He seeks to 
  bring the carnal believer to a point of repentance and to cooperation with God. 
  However in the words of the famous Campus Crusade booklet &#147;How to Be Filled 
  With The Holy Spirit&#148; (which I thoroughly recommend), &#147;self is on 
  the throne&#148;. The carnal Christian is a &#147;me first&#148; Christian led 
  by their own desires, and seeking their own interests and having their own agenda. 
  Christ may be in their life but He is not being allowed to fully direct their 
  lives. The struggle with the Holy Spirit will only end for them when they abdicate 
  from their throne, and instead decide to place Christ on the throne, obey His 
  commandments and be led by the Spirit not by their own desires. If you think 
  that this may apply to you why don&#146;t you consider praying a prayer somewhat 
  like the following:</p>
<p>&#147;Lord I am sorry that I have put self on the throne and run my life according 
  to my own desires rather than according to Your will. I repent of this and ask 
  that Christ may be on the throne and in the control room of my life, and that 
  I may be ruled by His desires, and by the Holy Spirit. I ask that You may fill 
  me with the Holy Spirit and produce in me a soft and obedient heart. In Jesus 
  name. Amen&#148;.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>The Low Biblical EQ Of Carnal Christians </b></p>
<p>The poor control carnal Christians have over their emotional life is due to 
  their lack of co-operation with the Holy Spirit and can be seen in:</p>
<p>Poor Impulse Control: Giving in to sexual immorality, drunkenness and even 
  in the disorder of their worship.</p>
<p>Poor Anger Management: Most notably the congregation that James wrote to which 
  were murdering each other (James 4:2) and the Galatians which were &quot;biting 
  and devouring&quot; each other. (Galatians 5:15)</p>
<p>Disintegrating Relationships: Envying, factions, strife and contentions. ( 
  1 Cor 3:3</p>
<p>Low Levels of Personal Motivation: They are variously described as evil beasts 
  and lazy gluttons (Titus 1:12-14) , neglectful, dull of hearing, and in danger 
  of drifting.</p>
<p>Instability: Following after &quot;the latest&quot; false teachers particularly 
  if they were good talkers and emotionally persuasive (2 Corinthians 11) and 
  being tossed around by every wind of doctrine.</p>
<p>Lack Of Basic Empathy and Compassion: Such as saying to a person who was without 
  food or shelter &quot;be warm and filled&quot; and not doing anything! Or dishonoring 
  the poor by making them sit in lowly places in church. (James 2).</p>
<p>A Toxic Tongue: Gossip, slander, and the like that proceeds from out of control 
  emotions. (James 3)</p>
<p>A Poisonous Personality: Such people are described as a &quot;root of bitterness 
  that defiles many&quot; or like the emotionally rigid Diotrephes who &quot;like 
  to put himself first&quot; and controlled the church (3 John).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>The Obvious Conclusion</b></p>
<p>So we see that our model for biblical EQ predicts accurately the disastrous 
  perceptions, beliefs, actions and reactions of people who are carnal Christians. 
  We see that the process we have outlined accurately predicts good and holy emotions 
  for those filled with the Spirit and negative and hateful emotions for those 
  who resist and grieve the Spirit. This leads to two conclusions. Firstly, that 
  our model seems to fit the biblical data and probably does describe the process 
  of emotional development and expression. More importantly it leads to the conclusion 
  that the single most important factor in a high biblical EQ is the work of the 
  Holy Spirit in the life of the co-operating and Spirit-filled believer. Those 
  most full of the Spirit are grand beings of deep emotional authenticity, Christians 
  that grieve the Spirit are emotional wrecks. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>However believers do not neatly fall into two camps, one with wonderful emotions 
  and the other with sharp, brittle and unstable emotions. That is because we 
  start at different points. Some Spirit-filled believers from emotionally difficult 
  backgrounds may have a lot of learning and growing to do with respect to their 
  emotions, but they are going in the right direction. In time, providing they 
  remain close to God, they will learn and grow and become more Christ-like in 
  their emotions. This seems to have been very much the case with Paul who went 
  from being very abrasive in his early years to very gracious in later life. 
  On the other hand some very worldly and carnal Christians are squandering a 
  wonderful emotional inheritance from a loving Christian family. They seem emotionally 
  together but in time, slowly but surely, emotional disintegration sets in and 
  generally becomes obvious by late middle age.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>What About Non-Believers?</b></p>
<p>What does our model say about non-believers? Generally non-believers are neither 
  cooperating with nor resisting the work of the Holy Spirit. Thus the emotional 
  life of non-believers should be normally distributed (that is &#147;on a bell 
  curve&#148;) around a central mean that is less than the emotional mean of Spirit-filled 
  Christians but perhaps not as low as that of truly carnal Christians. Since 
  the Spirit does not indwell unbelievers, the great inner work of the Spirit 
  is not there and the upper reaches of the Christian life are unavailable to 
  them. For instance they are generally not able to love their enemies. While 
  they may be very decent and loving people they will generally not have the tremendous 
  power and life, the &quot;zing&quot; that being like Christ produces. This deep 
  pulsating joy is almost exclusively a work of God in the regenerate believer. 
  Thus our model is not destroyed by the fact of the occasional good non-Christian.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It needs to be also said that God has His prevenient and common grace and the 
  Holy Spirit will give some external aid to anyone who seeks to live a good, 
  decent and loving life and encourages Jews, Buddhists, humanists and existentialists 
  alike to be decent human beings. In such people many Christian values will be 
  found in the belief system that undergirds their emotional life. Such people 
  who are seeking good, but have not yet found Christ may well be emotionally 
  together as they are cooperating with God in a stumbling sort of way. However 
  the deep transformational power of the Holy Spirit may well be lacking. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>The Conclusion So Far </b></p>
<p>1. The five step model accurately predicts the emotional state of both saintly 
  Christians and carnal Christians.</p>
<p>2. Emotional authenticity is entirely a work of the Holy Spirit . However it 
  can occur to some extent in non-believers who seek it as a work of common grace. 
  More commonly it is found in Spirit-filled believers who are walking in holiness.</p>
<p>3. Emotional functionality and authenticity come about through the person co-operating 
  with the Holy Spirit as He forms spiritual perspectives and a Christ-like belief 
  system in the person.</p>
<p>4. Resisting this work of the Holy Spirit results in emotional catastrophe.</p>
<p>5. Emotionally undeveloped Christians who remain close to God can grow into 
  emotionally adept people just as it seems Paul did.</p>
<p>6. Co-operating with God means not grieving or quenching the Holy Spirit and 
  being careful to avoid worldliness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Is There A Fast Track To A High Biblical EQ?</b></p>
<p>Obviously being Spirit-filled and obedient is a great place to start for emotional 
  growth. However Christians can also directly work on their emotions. Information 
  on how to do this has been provided in three ways; firstly God has given His 
  Son to show us what holy and true emotions look like, secondly He has given 
  us the special revelation in the Scriptures and their precise description of 
  the emotional life and the inner man, thirdly He has given His natural revelation 
  to scientists who so assiduously seek the truth about emotional growth. Combining 
  these together we will find out how to directly achieve emotional growth and 
  a high biblical EQ. That takes us to the next section of this book , the section 
  on the inner self which deals with how emotions are formed within us, and what 
  we can do about it. This section will give us the knowledge and tools we need 
  to work on our perceptions of reality and our belief systems and to renew them 
  and to produce Christ-like outcomes and godly emotions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Discussion Questions</b><br>
  <br>
  1. What are the emotional consequences for a Christian if they choose not to 
  cooperate with the work of the Holy Spirit?<br>
</p>
<p>2. What are the sins against the Holy Spirit?<br>
</p>
<p>3. What sort of descriptions does the Bible give of carnal Christians e.g. 
  &#147;sluggish&#148;. <br>
</p>
<p>4. Read the twelve predictions at the start of the chapter. What impression 
  do they make on you? What does it say about why some churches experience problems? 
  <br>
</p>
<p>5. How important is the Holy Spirit in developing the emotional life of Christians? 
  <br>
</p>
<p>6. Why can some non-Christians be in a better emotional state than some Christians? 
  Can emotionally clumsy Christians ever improve? <br>
