<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><b><font color="#006666">(Ephesians 3:19 NKJV) to 
  know the love of Christ which passes knowledge; that you may be filled with 
  all the fullness of God.</font></b></font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ephesians 3:19, quoted above, is my favorite bible verse. It never fails to 
  make me gasp in awe and wonder, especially the last phrase &#147;that you may 
  be filled with all the fullness of God&#148;. According to St. Paul you and 
  I can be filled with all the fullness of God. That is absolutely mind-boggling. 
  If this verse was not there in Scripture I would have called it heresy and never 
  dared to invent it. It&#146;s too much, and I cannot absorb it fully. God means 
  us to become like Jesus who was the fullness of Deity in bodily form (Colossians 
  2:9). We partake of that sort of fullness and are to grow up in all aspects 
  and be like Him. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am saying that we can partake of the fullness of God and be filled with it. 
  I am certainly not saying that we can become God. We will not be &#147;Him who 
  sitteth on the throne&#148;. We will be the ones waving palm branches and having 
  white robes and singing Alleluia in Heaven. Whatever being filled with all the 
  fullness of God means, it does not turn us into an object of worship, or make 
  us the Creator and sustainer of the Universe. Being filled with the fullness 
  of God is sharing a nature, and is what theologians call &#147;participating 
  in the communicable attributes of God&#148;. The incommunicable attributes such 
  as the &#145;omni&#146;s&#148; belong to God alone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This promise that through love we can be filled with the fullness of God is 
  a marvelous promise in the midst of a wonderful prayer. Lets look at the whole 
  of Paul&#146;s prayer and put it in its proper context.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(Ephesians 3:14-21 NKJV) For this reason I bow my knees to the Father of our 
  Lord Jesus Christ, {15} from whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, 
  {16} that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened 
  with might through His Spirit in the inner self, {17} that Christ may dwell 
  in your hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love, {18} 
  may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the width and length and 
  depth and height; {19} to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge; that 
  you may be filled with all the fullness of God. {20} Now to Him who is able 
  to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the 
  power that works in us, {21} to Him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus to 
  all generations, forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There is a succession of ideas and &#147;spiritual stages&#148; here, each 
  of which leads to the next and forms the foundation for the one to come:</p>
<p>1) We are strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner self.</p>
<p>2) This leads to Christ dwelling in our hearts by faith.</p>
<p>3) We then become rooted and grounded in love</p>
<p>4) We comprehend with all the saints the greatness of the love of Christ</p>
<p>5) That we may be filled with all the fullness of God.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The other chapters of this book have dealt with stage one - being strengthened 
  in our inner self and, achieving personal mastery. They have also dealt with 
  stage two and being focused firmly on Christ so He dwells in our heart by faith 
  and we experience life and peace. Then in the last few chapters we have started 
  exploring stage three and learned a bit being grounded in a loving lifestyle 
  where we express ourselves in edifying ways. </p>
<p>In this last chapter I shall try and take you through the last three stages 
  &#150; becoming rooted and grounded in love, comprehending the greatness of 
  the love of Christ and being filled with all the fullness of God. All three 
  final stages involve the mystery called love. The practice and the experience 
  of love, leads us to the fullness of God. The high reaches of the spiritual 
  life are about perfecting our ability to love God and love one another. Love 
  is the ultimate in biblical EQ. The ultimate use of our emotions is love of 
  God expressed in worship and that is the use they will be put to in Heaven. 
  The ultimate state of our emotions is pure love. The ultimate pitch of our emotions 
  is when we can love our enemies. </p>
<p> (Matthew 5:43-48 NKJV) &quot;You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love 
  your neighbor and hate your enemy.' {44} &quot;But I say to you, love your enemies, 
  bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those 
  who spitefully use you and persecute you, {45} &quot;that you may be sons of 
  your Father in heaven; for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, 
  and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. {46} &quot;For if you love those 
  who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? 
  {47} &quot;And if you greet your brethren only, what do you do more than others? 
  Do not even the tax collectors do so? {48} &quot;Therefore you shall be perfect, 
  just as your Father in heaven is perfect.</p>
<p>If we love our enemies we attain spiritual perfection. Loving our enemies and 
  blessing those who curse us leads us to become sons of our Father in heaven 
  (Matthew 5;43-45). In verse 48 Jesus&#146; apparently absurd command is &#147;you 
  shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect&#148;. This is as 
  &#145;ridiculous&#146; as saying we can be filled up with all the fullness of 
  God. The two apparently absurd statements are of course connected. Love leads 
  us to be in the fullness of God, and loving our enemies makes us perfect like 
  our Father in heaven. Both perfections are attained through strenuous love. 
  God desires us to dwell in perfect love where we can love friend and foe alike. 
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The path to spiritual perfection is the path of loving our enemies, overcoming 
  our fight or flight response, exercising our biblical EQ skills and dwelling 
  in a perfect benevolence towards all, free from animosity, hatred, revenge and 
  the spiteful impulses of the flesh. That is high ground indeed. {Let me quickly 
  add that as I said earlier in the book, Biblical EQ is only part of our sanctification 
  and a portion of God&#146;s work in us, however I think it is an important part.}</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Love is of course the fulfillment of the law, the perfection of what I am calling 
  Biblical EQ and the one great Attribute of the Christ-like nature. Every Christian 
  agrees with that. Its part of what Americans call &#147;motherhood and apple 
  pie&#148;. A global sentimental statement that makes us all feel warm and with 
  which no-one dare disagree but which is apparently of little real consequence 
  or practical value. In most bible studies everyone present can tell you love 
  is a good thing and fulfills the law and we should be doing more of it, and 
  the Good Samaritan was very nice and a wonderful example, and we should all 
  love God and our neighbors and that means everyone, Amen. So I&#146;m not going 
  to say any of that. You already know it. I&#146;m going to ask a few tough questions 
  such as &#147;Why don&#146;t we love very well at all, why are we still mainly 
  selfish and only love a little bit?&#148; and &#147;Paul talks of the love of 
  God being poured out in our hearts and this love transforming us from glory 
  to glory and even making us perfect and filling us with the fullness of God. 
  Was he just joking? Is that just theological waffle? Or is it for real? If its 
  for real how can we get hold of it?&#148; They are some of the real, &#147;where 
  the rubber hits the road&#148; questions of Christian living and this book is 
  all about those sort of questions, especially where they intersect with our 
  emotional life. But first a definition of love:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b><i>Love is a lawful and practical way of life, which we live out from Christ 
  within us, in a common benevolent connection with God and with others. </i></b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Love is lawful.</i> It rejoices in the truth and takes no pleasure in evil. 
  (1 Corinthians 13:6) The true follower of God in the O.T. was someone who &#147;loves 
  Me and keeps My commandments&#148; (Exodus 20:6, Deuteronomy 5:10). In the N.T. 
  love is demonstrated in keeping the commandments of Jesus Christ.( John 14:15, 
  21; 15:10 1 John 5:3) In 2 John love is even defined by obedience: &#147;This 
  is love, that we walk according to His commandments&#148; (2 John 1:6). Thus 
  love is not some kind of maverick sentimentality that can ride roughshod over 
  laws and do what it likes in pursuit of the grand passion. Love is God&#146;s 
  nature at work and God is lawful and holy so love is lawful also.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Love is practical.</i> As we saw in the chapters on beliefs our emotions 
  are meant to move us to Christian action. Faith working through love should 
  move us to do the good deeds that God has prepared beforehand for us to do (Ephesians 
  2:8-10, Galatians 5:6). The parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10;29-37) shows 
  that loving your neighbour often involves practical action. This is backed up 
  in innumerable passages in Scripture most notably James chapters 2 and 3 and 
  in 1 John, particularly 1 John 3:16-18. </p>
<p>(1 John 3:16-19 NKJV) By this we know love, because He laid down His life for 
  us. And we also ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. {17} But whoever 
  has this world's goods, and sees his brother in need, and shuts up his heart 
  from him, how does the love of God abide in him? {18} My little children, let 
  us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth. {19} And by this 
  we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before Him. </p>
<p>The specific practical help we are to love our enemies with is given in the 
  book of Romans. </p>
<p>(Romans 12:20-21 NKJV) Therefore &quot;If your enemy is hungry, feed him; If 
  he is thirsty, give him a drink; For in so doing you will heap coals of fire 
  on his head.&quot; {21} Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good. 
</p>
<p>Thus love is not a mere emotion detached from action. It is not a sentiment 
  that we &#147;can have in our hearts&#148; without ever acting on. Love is a 
  spur to action. Faith working through love moves us to do things of a practical 
  nature</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Love is a way of life.</i> (Ephesians 5:1-2 NKJV) Therefore be imitators 
  of God as dear children. {2} And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us and 
  given Himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling 
  aroma.</p>
<p>To &#147;walk in love&#148; means to make it our lifestyle. This lifestyle 
  is reflected in Acts chapters 2-7 where the early church is shown living in 
  love, helping widows, healing the sick, preaching the gospel, obeying the commandments 
  and enduring persecution in a noble and forgiving spirit. The lifestyle of the 
  early church was one of constant worship, constant fellowship, unity of soul 
  and spirit and an incredible desire to meet one another&#146;s needs (Acts 4:31-37).. 
  It was a lifestyle of love, empowered by the Holy Spirit and led by the apostles. 
  This sort of lifestyle love is called &#145;abiding in love&#148; in 1 John 
  and means dwelling from day to day in love so it totally characterises one&#146;s 
  life. The love we are called to, which perfects us, is thus not an occasional 
  spurt of affection. Nobody can be made into the fullness of God by an occasional 
  spurt of affection. Abiding love, that we can walk in and which transforms us, 
  is not the warm gooey feeling you get singing Scripture choruses, though it 
  is slightly related. Real love is a lot more solid and real and ethical and 
  practical than that. Lets keep going and see if we can figure out what this 
  abiding, transforming, lifestyle love is like.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Love is lived out from Christ within us </i>Love is a Jesus thing. Love 
  is what Jesus in us wants to do. Love flows from Christ within us. The natural 
  man cannot attain to this sort of love, the love that cares for enemies, that 
  abides in the commandments of God and makes us into the fullness of God. If 
  the natural man could do that then God would have kept Jesus in heaven. If the 
  natural man was adequate to become like God then there is no need for a cross, 
  a resurrection, an indwelling Holy Spirit and a new nature. So if we need a 
  new nature to love then the old nature is useless and the Law is useless. Law-keeping 
  does not makes us loving it only makes us defeated and condemned because we 
  are weak and the flesh always wins (Romans 5-8, Galatians 3&amp;4). At best 
  the Law is a holy, and righteous and good tutor that brings conviction of sin 
  and leads us to repentance. The natural man under the tutelage of the holy, 
  righteous and just law just ended up a sordid mess. The flesh ran rampant. God 
  got locked out. So God instituted a new covenant, in Christ, where the law is 
  written on our hearts by the Holy Spirit and the Christian life is lived from 
  the inside out, not from the law book in. </p>
<p>Listen! You can only live the Christian life one way &#150; from Jesus in you, 
  out to others and the world. Love is not a feeling that comes into you. Love 
  is living water that flows out of your inmost being because Christ dwells in 
  your hearts by faith. Hear ye! Hear ye! Hear ye! Christ in you is THE hope of 
  glory. The only hope, the sole hope, He is all you have got in the fight against 
  sin and the quest for a godly character. Your strength, intellect, cleverness, 
  willpower and rule-keeping cannot avail. They are not a &#145;hope of glory&#148;. 
  They are certain and agonising defeat. It is God who is at work within you! 
  Let the new man live the new life. Let Jesus in you love others through you. 
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But how? That was my question for years as people would talk about living the 
  new life from Christ within us. How do we get in touch with Christ within us 
  and how do we &#147;do it&#148;? It just seemed like so much theory to me, a 
  bit of swift-handed exegetical fiddling, a holding out of a hope that there 
  was no way to lay hold of. But the early church did know this love. It worked 
  for them and it can work for us. The secret is connection. Forge the connection 
  with God and with others, and maintain that connection like your life depended 
  on it, which it does, and Christ will flow out of your inmost being. No connection, 
  no flow, deep connection, deep flow. Lets look at that a bit further.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Love involves a common benevolent connection with God </i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1 Corinthians 6:17 NKJV) But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit with 
  Him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Many counseling theorists are now exploring the transformational power of love 
  as it flows in direct personal connection to God and to others. Our selfish 
  individuality has led us astray. For too long we have wanted counseling recipes 
  we can work on our own without having to open up to God or man. We are discovering 
  that God has designed His world to be firstly connected to Him and then to one 
  another in a huge inter-connected cascade of love. In this regard I recommend 
  the recent work of Larry Crabb and his book Connecting. I also recommend the 
  work of Dr Ed Smith in Theophostics. These are just two people in a vast and 
  growing movement trying to explore the transformational aspects of relationship 
  to God and others. We are not islands, we are people and people need connection. 
  This connection is a vital part of our EQ and a key to maturing in Christ. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#147;To know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge that you may be filled..&#148; 
  (Ephesians 3:19). The knowing of the love is vital. It&#146;s the connection 
  that is transformational. Its knowing Christ, and the extent of His love, that 
  matures us. It&#146;s the experiencing of that relationship, and being rooted 
  and grounded in love, which stabilizes us. I commenced my Christian life believing 
  that I should be &#147;well grounded in the Scriptures&#148; and that was good 
  and helpful. However it was only much later that I saw the need to be rooted 
  and grounded in love and in Christ. You and I are grounded in a personal relationship 
  with our Saviour. Now even if my Bible was confiscated I would still have my 
  rock solid foundation in my relationship with God. The Scriptures have contributed 
  immensely to that relationship of course. However I relate to a Person not a 
  set of Scriptures or even a set of elegant doctrines. Now its God&#146;s Spirit 
  within me, and His personal connection to me, that changes me from glory to 
  glory. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2 Corinthians 3:17-18 NKJV) Now the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit 
  of the Lord is, there is liberty. {18} But we all, with unveiled face, beholding 
  as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image 
  from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Jews had the Torah but we have Christ and with unveiled faces we behold 
  Him and by the power of the Spirit we are transformed, rooted and grounded and 
  perfected in love, and go from glory to glory until we reach the fullness of 
  God.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Connection is everything and through it we receive the love that truly changes 
  us. God is our greatest and only real need. We do not need to go on eating, 
  or working or breathing, but we do need to stay in connection with God. We establish 
  that connection at our conversion when we repent from sin and being disconnected 
  and place our faith in Christ. We maintain that connection through setting our 
  minds on the Spirit, on things above, and on Christ and the interests of God. 
  We need to make a definite clear commitment to fix our minds in the right place. 
  That&#146;s the only thing we can do to keep the connection open. The mind is 
  the only part of our consciousness we can control. Fixing it on God through 
  prayer, meditation and concentrated love in the Spirit is all I can humanly 
  do to maintain my transforming link with God. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Through the transforming work this connection works in me I gain mastery over 
  the fight or flight response, over the flesh and all the wrong impulses it contains. 
  Through this connection I find the power to be obedient and I obey, in the Spirit, 
  not according to the letter. Over time the Spirit produces His fruit in me and 
  I bear love, joy and peace and become humble, meek, patient, gentle, kind and 
  full of self-control. I begin to love my enemies and pray for those who persecute 
  me. I have the strength in the inner self not to retaliate. I become rooted 
  and grounded in love and my world moves from being self-centred to God centred 
  and other-serving. I start communicating with grace and ministering effectively 
  and grasping the height and depth and width and length of the love of God until, 
  many years from now, I am filled up with all the fullness of God.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This connection seems horribly fragile at first and the Devil tries his best 
  to break it. He assails it with doubt, confusion, distraction, lust, and every 
  spiritual attack he can manage. The first part of this book addresses those 
  concerns and it is clear that we can damage our connection through sin and carnality. 
  Now lets look at what the Scriptures say about the nature of our connection 
  to God. As you read the Scriptures below notice: a) What God has done to establish 
  the connection with us, and the nature of that connection. b) What we must do 
  to maintain the connection, c) How our connection with God also means connection 
  with other Christians.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(Romans 5:1-5 NKJV) Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace 
  with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, {2} through whom also we have access 
  by faith into this grace in which we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory 
  of God. {3} And not only that, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that 
  tribulation produces perseverance; {4} and perseverance, character; and character, 
  hope. {5} Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured 
  out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1 Corinthians 6:17 NKJV) But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit with 
  Him. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1 Corinthians 15:2 NKJV) by which also you are saved, if you hold fast that 
  word which I preached to you; unless you believed in vain.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2 Corinthians 5:20 NKJV) Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though 
  God were pleading through us: we implore you on Christ's behalf, be reconciled 
  to God.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(Ephesians 2:13-22 NKJV) But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off 
  have been brought near by the blood of Christ. {14} For He Himself is our peace, 
  who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of separation, {15} 
  having abolished in His flesh the enmity, that is, the law of commandments contained 
  in ordinances, so as to create in Himself one new man from the two, thus making 
  peace, {16} and that He might reconcile them both to God in one body through 
  the cross, thereby putting to death the enmity. {17} And He came and preached 
  peace to you who were afar off and to those who were near. {18} For through 
  Him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father. {19} Now, therefore, you 
  are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints 
  and members of the household of God, {20} having been built on the foundation 
  of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief corner stone, 
  {21} in whom the whole building, being joined together, grows into a holy temple 
  in the Lord, {22} in whom you also are being built together for a dwelling place 
  of God in the Spirit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(Colossians 2:17-19 NKJV) which are a shadow of things to come, but the substance 
  is of Christ. {18} Let no one cheat you of your reward, taking delight in false 
  humility and worship of angels, intruding into those things which he has not 
  seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind, {19} and not holding fast to the 
  Head, from whom all the body, nourished and knit together by joints and ligaments, 
  grows with the increase that is from God. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1 Timothy 6:10-12 NKJV) For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, 
  for which some have strayed from the faith in their greediness, and pierced 
  themselves through with many sorrows. {11} But you, O man of God, flee these 
  things and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, gentleness. 
  {12} Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, to which you were 
  also called and have confessed the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(James 4:8 NKJV) Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your 
  hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(Revelation 2:13 NKJV) &quot;I know your works, and where you dwell, where 
  Satan's throne is. And you hold fast to My name, and did not deny My faith even 
  in the days in which Antipas was My faithful martyr, who was killed among you, 
  where Satan dwells.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>God has done an enormous preparatory work. He has brought us near by the blood 
  of Christ, which cleanses us from sin and allows us to approach the throne of 
  grace in time of need (Hebrews 4:14-16). We have access to the Father through 
  the Spirit and this access is so intimate that Paul says we are joined to the 
  Lord and one spirit with Him (1 Corinthians 6:17). We are at peace with God 
  (Romans 5:1-5) and the love of God pours into our hearts through the Holy Spirit 
  who is given to us. Yet as we saw earlier we can grieve and quench and resist 
  the Spirit by sinning. Maintaining the connection means maintaining a good relationship 
  with the Holy Spirit who is our access to God (Ephesians 2:18). To keep that 
  connection wide open and draw near to God we must purify our hearts if we are 
  double-minded and put away sin (James 4:8). We also need to deal with speculative 
  spirituality that can disconnect us from the Head which is Christ (Colossians 
  2:19). We have to flee greed and worldliness and the love of money and pursue 
  virtue as Timothy did so that we may lay hold of eternal life (1 Timothy 6:10-12). 
  Keeping our connection strong may involve some vigorous effort, in the midst 
  of persecution we may have to hold fast and not deny the faith, an injunction 
  that appears man times in the letters to the seven churches (Revelation 2:13). 
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What we are doing in all this is not inventing a new law but maintaining an 
  existing relationship we have with God through faith according to His grace. 
  Our relationship started with a faith connection to God and it is maintained 
  by keeping that faith connection in good shape so that the Christian life can 
  be said to be &#147;from faith to faith&#148;. </p>
<p>(Romans 1:17 NKJV) For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith 
  to faith; as it is written, &quot;The just shall live by faith.&quot;</p>
<p>Now the faith connection is kept in good shape by intensely loving God, and 
  having our minds fixed on Him so His Spirit can touch our consciousness, which 
  is absolutely staked on things above. Christ in me wants to focus His entire 
  attention on the Father and the things of the Spirit but for some reason that 
  God has built into things, it requires my mind to be set on things above. There 
  is an act of my will before Christ can most fully connect. As the Father communicates 
  with His Son in me, by the Spirit which gives us access to the Father, I experience 
  grace and am transformed. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This grace requires my faith. I must trust God and trust His word and launch 
  out and rest myself on Him. As I draw near to God by faith I will naturally 
  move away from sin. If I want to stay near to sin, it is very hard to draw near 
  to God. Faith means trusting that God is a rewarder of those who seek Him. Faith 
  is the inner pragmatic calculation that the goodness I will receive through 
  my connection with God far outweighs the goodness I think I will receive through 
  sin. It&#146;s a decision that the word of God is reliable, and that the reward 
  He promised will arrive, and that God is utterly trustworthy. God gives me a 
  hint that this is so through the Holy Spirit, which is the guarantee of the 
  inheritance to come. As I make this definite, tough, strong decision to seek 
  my goodness in God and not in sin the Christ life within me is fully released.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is &#147;holding fast&#148;. I do not mean that you need to hold fast 
  or you will fall away. It&#146;s not that sort of holding fast. You are not 
  in a precarious relationship with an angry Creator. You stand forgiven in the 
  love of God. The problem is &#147;me&#148;, not God, it is I who break the connection 
  not Him. I hold fast in order not to disconnect myself from the Head or grieve 
  the Holy Spirit that pours Himself out into my heart. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lets try it another way. The relationship with God is rock solid on His side. 
  I do not have to do anything to please Him. I am justified by faith alone and 
  not by any works of the law. I am safe in grace. Its like a marriage here in 
  the Philippines where there is no possibility of divorce. You can sin all your 
  like in that marriage and theoretically and legally it will never rupture. It 
  is rock solid. But I love my wife and I value our relationship and I have no 
  wish to grieve her so I do not sin against her. Similarly I am safe with God, 
  and legally speaking the relationship is rock solid, I can sin a great deal 
  and still He will be faithful even though I am faithless (2 Timothy 2:13). But 
  if I did so the transforming relationship of agape love would be in tatters. 
  I have no desire to grieve Him, and so I choose not to sin, not because I &#147;have 
  to&#148; in order to get into heaven, but because I want to in order to know 
  Him more fully and because I want to be transformed by His love being poured 
  out in my heart through the Holy Spirit. I have decided for the fullness of 
  the Christ-like life. However sin grieves Him. Sin is disruptive to our relationship 
  so it must go. I don&#146;t want it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What incentive do I have to make this tough decision? And what has it got to 
  do with love, which after all is the subject of this chapter? This love that 
  we abide in, and walk in, and which penetrates every corner of our being, is 
  the royal highway to the highest reaches of the Christian life and the very 
  ground of all that you and I will inherit in Christ. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As we love, we fulfill the Law (Romans 13:10), become imitators of God (Ephesians 
  5:1,2), and perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect (Matthew 5:43-48), we 
  attain to all the fullness of God (Ephesians 3:19), and we abide in God and 
  He abides in us (1 John 4:16), and we become like Him (1 John 3:1-3) and share 
  key aspects of His nature so the apostle can say &#147;as He is, we are&#148;. 
  (1 John 4:17). This is not heresy it is Scripture. God intends us to be like 
  Jesus, in every aspect and to be full of love. That is, we are to be spiritual, 
  eternal, loving, wise and mature like Jesus is. We are the redeemed (Revelation 
  5:8-10). We are the brands snatched from the fire (Zechariah 3). We are the 
  ones clothed in white standing before the throne of God, and as we stand there 
  we will realise that we are like Him (1 John 3:1-3). Our destiny is to bear 
  his image (Romans 8:28-31) and we will be eternal, and immortal, and clothed 
  in a spiritual body, (1 Corinthians 15: 42-54). We will be so like Him that 
  Jesus will not be ashamed to call us brethren (Hebrews 2:11-17). God has done 
  something magnificent in us by grace, and seated us in heavenly realms with 
  himself that the succeeding ages may marvel (Ephesians 2:4-7). The inheritance 
  I want is to be so transformed by God&#146;s blazing love poured out in my heart 
  that I am made utterly like Jesus Christ. That is something worth focussing 
  on, and it makes leaving sin alone very worthwhile. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Love involves connecting with others</i></p>
<p>At this point some of you are probably saying something like &#147;John, I 
  thought this was going to be a wonderful, practical book, but you go and ruin 
  it at the end with all that theology&#148;. Aha! This is the point, I could 
  have left it as a &#145;wonderful how-to book&#148; and you could have tried 
  to put it into action in your own strength. And you would have done what you 
  have always done and got what you have always got. Unless you learn to tap into 
  the power of Jesus within you this book will only be a little bit useful to 
  you. However if you get that connection going and God&#146;s power is at work 
  within you and you set your sights on having your emotions redeemed so you can 
  be like Jesus and love people &#150; then, guess what? You will make ten times 
  the progress. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now lets go back to our definition of love: Love is a lawful and practical 
  way of life, which we live out from Christ within us, in a common benevolent 
  connection with God and with others. What&#146;s the &#147;and others&#148;? 
  What is so special about the early church? How come people loved each other? 
  How come my church is cold and dead and selfish? Going back to one of the questions 
  I started this chapter with: &#147;Why don&#146;t we love very well at all, 
  why are we still mainly selfish?&#148; </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Selfishness comes from people who believe in preserving themselves, at all 
  costs, and being competitive. The selfish person who pushes into the queue at 
  the ATM is self-preserving (of their time) and competitive (with the others 
  in the queue). Selfishness results in envy and selfish ambition and a whole 
  lists of rotten behaviors that cause disorder in churches and communities and 
  are very well described in James 3 and Galatians 5. In direct contrast with 
  this, love of others flows from self-giving via the cross. Lets look at a very 
  famous passage of Scripture:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(John 3:16-18 NKJV) &quot;For God so loved the world that He gave His only 
  begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting 
  life. {17} &quot;For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the 
  world, but that the world through Him might be saved. {18} &quot;He who believes 
  in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because 
  he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When God wanted to love the world He did not send a poem. He did not send an 
  email with a nice graphic and a catchy tune. He sent His Son, thus He gave Himself. 
  When we love others we send a bit of ourselves to them. When Christ loves others 
  through us, He sends a bit of Himself to others through us. Early in my ministry 
  I received a very nice note from a couple in the church who said, among other 
  things &#147;we see God&#146;s love shining out through you.&#148; I was flabbergasted 
  and humbled. I had no idea that God&#146;s love could be seen in me. All I could 
  see was my mistakes. Somehow Jesus had given Himself to others through me. As 
  Paul said, (2 Corinthians 4:7 NKJV) But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, 
  that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us. Thus when I love 
  others I establish a connection and send a bit of myself along that connection 
  to them, at the same time Christ uses that connection to send Himself to them. 
  God is still sending His Son into the world &#150; through you and I. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Just in case you think I have gone all mad and mystical, go over the metaphors 
  for the Church in Scripture. Christ is the Head of the church, which is His 
  body, and so when parts of his body love a person He is loving the person. When 
  I hold my wife&#146;s hand, it is not just my hand that is loving Minda, it 
  is all of me, including my head and heart. Similarly when a part of Christ&#146;s 
  body loves someone it is also Jesus loving someone. I went through a very dark 
  time in my life once that lasted for a few months. Every time I was at my lowest 
  a certain chatty friend would appear from nowhere with some of my favourite 
  junk food and restore my spirits. Anne was like an angel. She was Christ ministering 
  to me. In her I saw and felt God&#146;s love. God sent Jesus wrapped up in Anne. 
  This identification between Christ and His people is so close that when Jesus 
  revealed Himself to Saul on the Damascus Road , He said &#147;Saul, Saul why 
  are you persecuting Me?&#148; and &#147;I am Jesus who you are persecuting.&#148; 
  To persecute the church was to persecute Jesus.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(Acts 9:4-5 NKJV) Then he fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to him, 
  &quot;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?&quot; {5} And he said, &quot;Who 
  are You, Lord?&quot; Then the Lord said, &quot;I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. 
  It is hard for you to kick against the goads.&quot;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Christ is in His body. Where His body goes Jesus goes, what His body loves 
  Jesus loves. What His body forgives, Jesus forgives. (John 20:23, James 5:15) 
  What His body binds and looses on earth is bound and loosed in heaven. (Matthew 
  18:15-20). Thus there is a very intimate relationship between the love of Jesus 
  and the love of His church. Jesus still loves the world in the sense of John 
  3:16, and Jesus wants to love the world, through His body the church. He wants 
  to release His incredible love into His body that they in turn may release it 
  to the world. The church in the early chapters of Acts was a community filled 
  with the transformational love of Jesus that then went out and loved people 
  and changed the world. The basic job of the Church is not evangelism, its loving 
  people. Loving them into maturity in Christ. (Ephesians 4:11-16)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ok why are so many churches cold and selfish or only lukewarm in their love? 
  Here are a dozen or so reasons that may apply:</p>
<p>1) They have little idea of the Christ-centred and Spirit-filled life and are 
  struggling along in legalism.</p>
<p>2) They have lost the vision or knowledge that the main task of the church 
  is loving people into maturity in Christ.</p>
<p>3) Their concept of love is weak and little more than &#147;being nice to people&#148; 
  combined with the odd affectionate statement. It lacks reality or practicality.</p>
<p>4) They have descended into fleshly behaviour or worldly behaviour and grieved 
  the Spirit.</p>
<p>5) They have opted for control and respectability and quenched the Spirit.</p>
<p>6) They focus on the things of this world such as current events or politics 
  or even good counseling theories rather than on Christ. </p>
<p>7) They have no mastery, no focus, no disciplined mental attitude, they are 
  not steadily connected to Christ but are unstable, and are blown here and there 
  by the latest fashions / &#147;winds of doctrine&#148;.</p>
<p>8) They have opted for liberal theology or New Age trends and follow the teachings 
  of men, which have the appearance of wisdom and godliness, but lack any real 
  transforming power. </p>
<p>9) They are riddled with disunity; this robs them of power and love.</p>
<p>10) They are spiritually lazy and hard of hearing or they opt for comfort and 
  avoid the cross.</p>
<p>11) They are financially dishonest like Ananias and Sapphira.</p>
<p>12) There is gross sin or immorality in the leadership.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>How then can the church be brought back to a place of burning blazing love 
  where it loves Jesus above all and where we love one another with powerful agape 
  love based in the Spirit so that Jesus is giving Himself away all day long in 
  our midst? How can we get this &#147;connecting with one another in the power 
  of Christ and the love of the Holy Spirit&#148; thing going? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>1) Fix any of the above 12 faults that are wrong.</p>
<p>2) Renew worship so it is absolutely Christ-centred. Teach on the life and 
  ministry of Jesus.</p>
<p>3) Fix their minds on eternity and seek the presence of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>4) Give people a vision for real biblical love as described in this chapter 
  and get them thirsty for it.</p>
<p>5) Follow the leadings of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>6) Engage in real, helpful practical one-another ministry (see Gene Getz&#146;s 
  excellent book on the one another commands). Love one another in deed and truth, 
  not just word and tongue.</p>
<p>7) Try and build an adventurous, faith-filled learning community as described 
  earlier in this book.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All I am saying is connect the Church to God, and get them to release Christ 
  in them to one another, then stand back. In a functioning Christian community 
  the whole community is connected upwards to Jesus Christ who is the Head and 
  then horizontally as Christ in us ministers to one another through an amazing 
  network of interpersonal connections that carry the love of God. If each person 
  is Christ-focused and self-giving then enormous power is present as they become 
  one in the Spirit. I am not talking about the cultish Groupthink or group conformity, 
  but a creative Spirit-filled diversity, where people are one in soul and spirit 
  but as different as can be individually.</p>
<p>(Ephesians 4:11-16 NKJV) And He Himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, 
  some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers, {12} for the equipping of the 
  saints for the work of ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, {13} 
  till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of 
  God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ; 
  {14} that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried about 
  with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning craftiness 
  of deceitful plotting, {15} but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up in 
  all things into Him who is the head; Christ; {16} from whom the whole body, 
  joined and knit together by what every joint supplies, according to the effective 
  working by which every part does its share, causes growth of the body for the 
  edifying of itself in love.</p>
<p>Those who minister should edify the body of Christ into unity of the faith 
  and the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the 
  stature of the fullness of Christ. We are back to where we began this chapter 
  taking of the fullness of God. This fullness is achieved in community. Its something 
  the body achieves for its members. We don&#146;t do it to ourselves. We have 
  to love people and be loved by people if the fullness is going to happen for 
  us. How do we get there? By speaking the truth in love, (v.15) and speaking 
  the truth in love is a pretty good definition of what biblical EQ enables us 
  to do. THE END</p>
