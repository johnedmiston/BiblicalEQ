  - In And By The Spirit </font></b></font> </div>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow"><b><font color="#006666">(Mark 2:8 NKJV) But immediately, 
  when Jesus perceived in His spirit that they reasoned thus within themselves, 
  He said to them, &quot;Why do you reason about these things in your hearts?</font></b></font></p>
<p><font color="#006666"><b><font face="Arial Narrow">(Acts 17:16 NKJV) Now while 
  Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him when he saw 
  that the city was given over to idols.</font></b></font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The spirit is the place of intuition, dreams, visions and revelation and of 
  the deepest intimacy and the most direct kind of knowledge. It is the deepest 
  part of our humanity and it is the place where we &quot;know that we know..&quot;. 
  The primary functions of the spirit are wisdom and perception and knowledge. 
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Bible often talks about our spiritual eyes and ears and of people's ability 
  or inability to perceive spiritual things. The spiritual man of 1 Corinthians 
  2:10-16 is the person who is most at home perceiving things spiritually and 
  accurately. In a few places the NT makes the seemingly strange assertion that 
  it would be a good idea if all Christians were prophets. What it most probably 
  means is that all Christians are to become people of accurate spiritual perception 
  and have a deep intuition of spiritual reality. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>[This includes sensing what is God's will in the immediate situation like the 
  New Testament prophet Agabus did (Acts 11:28, 21:11,12). The considerable difference 
  between OT prophets and NT prophets is well brought out by the systematic theologian 
  Wayne Grudem in his book &quot;The Gift Of Prophecy&quot;. Again I will just 
  refer the interested reader to this work and move on.] </p>
<p> </p>
<p>What is clear is that Christians are to move from a place of very obscure spiritual 
  perception prior to conversion to a place of abundant and accurate spiritual 
  perception. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b><i>Prior to conversion &#150; darkness:</i></b></p>
<p>(1 Corinthians 2:14 NKJV) But the natural man does not receive the things of 
  the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because 
  they are spiritually discerned.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2 Corinthians 3:13-16 NKJV) unlike Moses, who put a veil over his face so 
  that the children of Israel could not look steadily at the end of what was passing 
  away. {14} But their minds were blinded. For until this day the same veil remains 
  unlifted in the reading of the Old Testament, because the veil is taken away 
  in Christ. {15} But even to this day, when Moses is read, a veil lies on their 
  heart. {16} Nevertheless when one turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2 Corinthians 4:3-4 NKJV) But even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to 
  those who are perishing, {4} whose minds the god of this age has blinded, who 
  do not believe, lest the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is 
  the image of God, should shine on them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(Ephesians 4:18 NKJV) having their understanding darkened, being alienated 
  from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the 
  blindness of their heart;</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><b>After conversion - universal and abundant spiritual revelation:</b></i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(Hebrews 8:10-12 NKJV) &quot;For this is the covenant that I will make with 
  the house of Israel after those days, says the LORD: I will put My laws in their 
  mind and write them on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall 
  be My people. {11} &quot;None of them shall teach his neighbor, and none his 
  brother, saying, 'Know the LORD,' for all shall know Me, from the least of them 
  to the greatest of them. {12} &quot;For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, 
  and their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more.&quot;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1 John 2:20 NKJV) But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you know 
  all things.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1 John 2:27 NKJV) But the anointing which you have received from Him abides 
  in you, and you do not need that anyone teach you; but as the same anointing 
  teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is not a lie, and just as 
  it has taught you, you will abide in Him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(Acts 2:16-18 NKJV) &quot;But this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel: 
  {17} 'And it shall come to pass in the last days, says God, That I will pour 
  out of My Spirit on all flesh; Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, 
  Your young men shall see visions, Your old men shall dream dreams. {18} And 
  on My menservants and on My maidservants I will pour out My Spirit in those 
  days; And they shall prophesy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1 Corinthians 14:31 NKJV) For you can all prophesy one by one, that all may 
  learn and all may be encouraged.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is truly a vast transition in our nature. We go from being spiritually 
  blind and without understanding, to being able to sense spiritual realities 
  and both understand and enjoy them. We may even sense them so keenly that we 
  are able to edify the Church. A whole new way of seeing things is opened up. 
  This is variously called &quot;being quickened in spirit&quot;, &quot;having 
  the eyes of your heart enlightened.&quot; or having one's spiritual eyes and 
  ears &#147;opened&#148; to spiritual reality. This work of the Holy Spirit that 
  is quite independent of human intellect (see 1 Corinthians chapters 1-4 ). Some 
  very intelligent people are spiritually blind while some simple folk grasp the 
  things of the Kingdom. Jesus rejoiced in seeing simple people grasping great 
  spiritual realities by faith alone and being obviously taught by God.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(Matthew 11:25 NKJV) At that time Jesus answered and said, &quot;I thank You, 
  Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the 
  wise and prudent and have revealed them to babes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(Matthew 16:17 NKJV) Jesus answered and said to him, &quot;Blessed are you, 
  Simon Bar-Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father 
  who is in heaven.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thus true spiritual perception which gives poise and balance to life and underlies 
  true emotional stability is a gift of God. While spiritual perception is a sovereign 
  work of God it can also be gained through prayer (James 1:5-8) and Paul prays 
  for spiritual insight to be granted to Christians in many of the famous prayers 
  in his epistles.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(Ephesians 1:18 NKJV) the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that 
  you may know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory 
  of His inheritance in the saints,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(Philippians 1:9 NKJV) And this I pray, that your love may abound still more 
  and more in knowledge and all discernment,</p>
<p> </p>
<p> (Colossians 1:9 NKJV) For this reason we also, since the day we heard it, 
  do not cease to pray for you, and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge 
  of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(Colossians 2:2 NKJV) that their hearts may be encouraged, being knit together 
  in love, and attaining to all riches of the full assurance of understanding, 
  to the knowledge of the mystery of God, both of the Father and of Christ,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He asks for &quot;all wisdom and spiritual understanding&quot; for the Colossians 
  and goes on His knees for it. The first place the biblical exegete must start 
  is on his or her knees asking the Lord to break open the word of God in all 
  wisdom and spiritual understanding. Commentaries have their place but they are 
  ineffective if the ability to perceive spiritual things is not there to start 
  with. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Spiritual Sensitivity and EQ</b></p>
<p>Well what has spiritual sensitivity got to do with our emotions and our biblical 
  EQ?:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1. Spiritual sensitivity opens our eyes to God&#146;s love and thus allows 
  us to be solidly grounded as persons..</p>
<p> (Ephesians 3:16-19 NKJV) that He would grant you, according to the riches 
  of His glory, to be strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner 
  man, {17} that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being 
  rooted and grounded in love, {18} may be able to comprehend with all the saints 
  what is the width and length and depth and height; {19} to know the love of 
  Christ which passes knowledge; that you may be filled with all the fullness 
  of God.</p>
<p> To be so able to perceive the love of Christ that we are rooted and grounded 
  in love and even filled up to all the fullness of God (that stretches the mind, 
  O God make it come true!) must be the ultimate in emotional stability.</p>
<p>2. Spiritual perception gives us the right spiritual passions such as Jesus 
  beholding Jerusalem and seeing it with his spirit ,and reacting with compassion. 
  With right spiritual perception we see the lost, our church and our city and 
  our nation through the eyes of Jesus Christ. We will experience the vast range 
  of spiritual emotions from weeping over the lost to indignation over cruelty 
  and hardness of heart. Whatever our emotion - it will be the Spirit's emotion 
  based on the Spirit's perception of that situation.</p>
<p>3. Spiritual sensitivity allows us to be grounded in faith and in the spiritual 
  realm not on sight and human reason and sentiment alone. (For we walk by faith 
  not by sight.) Moses was able be steadfast in the face of threats from a tyrannical 
  Pharaoh because of his special spiritual perception. Hebrews 11:27 NKJV) By 
  faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured as 
  seeing Him who is invisible. Just as Moses did not fear the Pharaoh and all 
  the pursuing chariots of Egypt because he could &quot;see Him who is invisible&quot; 
  so spiritual perception allows us to discern situations so that fear and anxiety 
  is removed from them. Under pressure and trials we still see the Presence of 
  an all-loving God. A God who is working all things together for our good. (Romans 
  8:28). </p>
<p>4. Occasionally people of high spiritual sensitivity will be granted a revelation 
  that turns the whole situation around and has an effect not just on their emotions 
  but the emotions of all involved. For instance Paul's revelation from God during 
  the storm at sea:</p>
<p>(Acts 27:19-26 NKJV) On the third day we threw the ship's tackle overboard 
  with our own hands. {20} Now when neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, 
  and no small tempest beat on us, all hope that we would be saved was finally 
  given up&#133;.. {22} &quot;And now I urge you to take heart, for there will 
  be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship. {23} &quot;For there stood 
  by me this night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve, {24} 
  &quot;saying, 'Do not be afraid, Paul; you must be brought before Caesar; and 
  indeed God has granted you all those who sail with you.' {25} &quot;Therefore 
  take heart, men, for I believe God that it will be just as it was told me. {26} 
  &quot;However, we must run aground on a certain island.&quot;&#133;. (Acts 27:33-36 
  NKJV) And as day was about to dawn, Paul implored them all to take food, saying, 
  &quot;Today is the fourteenth day you have waited and continued without food, 
  and eaten nothing. {34} &quot;Therefore I urge you to take nourishment, for 
  this is for your survival, since not a hair will fall from the head of any of 
  you.&quot; {35} And when he had said these things, he took bread and gave thanks 
  to God in the presence of them all; and when he had broken it he began to eat. 
  {36} Then they were all encouraged, and also took food themselves.</p>
<p>The situation in verses 19 &amp; 20 is such utter despair that &quot;all hope 
  that we would be saved was given up&quot;. Then in verse 22 an angel appears 
  with a revelation from God to spiritually sensitive Paul. Paul's faith in this 
  revelation caused him to be able to encourage others so they ate, acted appropriately 
  during the crisis and had hope. Thus Paul's openness to the spiritual realm 
  made him able to receive a revelation that had a profound effect on the lives 
  of all aboard.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Errors in Spiritual Perception And Their Effect On A Christian's Emotional 
  Life</b></p>
<p>I discussing errors in perception am not talking about errors in doctrine - 
  that will be covered in the chapter on beliefs. This chapter is on perception, 
  viewpoints, world-view, perspectives etc. that underlie our beliefs. For instance 
  errors in spiritual perception include blindness - but the resultant beliefs 
  of such blindness are varied. If you are blind to God and His salvation through 
  Christ, then false beliefs of all shapes and sizes, can arise in the darkness 
  within you. Thus the disorder of perception lays the foundation for the disorder 
  in belief. In this section we will deal with what happens when our human spirit 
  goes awry and how this distorts our whole perspective on life. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Inability To Perceive The Obvious:</i> This is called &quot; a spirit of 
  stupor&quot; and implies that the hearers are dull to the point of senselessness 
  to spiritual thing. Those addressed in the epistle to the Hebrews were called 
  &quot;dull of hearing&quot; and the synagogue Jews were warned by Paul:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(Acts 28:25-28 NKJV) &#133;&quot;The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through Isaiah 
  the prophet to our fathers, {26} &quot;saying, 'Go to this people and say: &quot;Hearing 
  you will hear, and shall not understand; And seeing you will see, and not perceive; 
  {27} For the hearts of this people have grown dull. Their ears are hard of hearing, 
  And their eyes they have closed, Lest they should see with their eyes and hear 
  with their ears, Lest they should understand with their hearts and turn, So 
  that I should heal them.&quot;' {28} &quot;Therefore let it be known to you 
  that the salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear 
  it!&quot;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(Romans 11:8 NKJV) Just as it is written: &quot;God has given them a spirit 
  of stupor, Eyes that they should not see And ears that they should not hear, 
  To this very day.&quot;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>People in the &quot;spirit of stupor&quot; fail to &quot;get it&quot;. They 
  live life with practically no true spiritual awareness though they may be outwardly 
  religious. If they are religious they tend to be stubborn and quite rejecting 
  of anyone who has genuine spiritual experience. Emotionally they are at ground 
  zero with a purely human perspective on life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Paying Attention To Deceptive Spirits:</i> Just as the Holy Spirit is our 
  Teacher , Satan is our deceiver! Spirits can and do tell lies and Christians 
  who pay attention to them can become unstable both spiritually and emotionally 
  and be drawn away from the faith.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1 Timothy 4:1-2 NKJV) Now the Spirit expressly says that in latter times some 
  will depart from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and doctrines of 
  demons, {2} speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their own conscience seared with 
  a hot iron,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2 Corinthians 11:4 NKJV) For if he who comes preaches another Jesus whom we 
  have not preached, or if you receive a different spirit which you have not received, 
  or a different gospel which you have not accepted; you may well put up with 
  it!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(Matthew 24:4-13 NKJV) And Jesus answered and said to them: &quot;Take heed 
  that no one deceives you. {5} &quot;For many will come in My name, saying, 'I 
  am the Christ,' and will deceive many. &#133;{11} &quot;Then many false prophets 
  will rise up and deceive many. {12} &quot;And because lawlessness will abound, 
  the love of many will grow cold. {13} &quot;But he who endures to the end shall 
  be saved.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2 Thessalonians 2:3-13 NKJV) Let no one deceive you by any means; for that 
  Day will not come unless the falling away comes first, and the man of sin is 
  revealed, the son of perdition, {4} who opposes and exalts himself above all 
  that is called God or that is worshiped, so that he sits as God in the temple 
  of God, showing himself that he is God. &#133;{9} The coming of the lawless 
  one is according to the working of Satan, with all power, signs, and lying wonders, 
  {10} and with all unrighteous deception among those who perish, because they 
  did not receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved. {11} And for 
  this reason God will send them strong delusion, that they should believe the 
  lie, {12} that they all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had 
  pleasure in unrighteousness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(Revelation 16:13-14 NKJV) And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs coming 
  out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the 
  mouth of the false prophet. {14} For they are spirits of demons, performing 
  signs, which go out to the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather 
  them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Spiritual deception involves an opposite kind of error to hardness of heart. 
  Those who are hard of heart miss seeing the good while those who are spiritually 
  deceived miss seeing the evil. The carnal nature of false teachers, their lies, 
  immorality and lust for money is overlooked. The deceived person does not love 
  the truth and does not really seek it. (2 Thessalonians 2:10,11). Rather they 
  pursue signs and wonders and good feelings. The promises of wealth and freedom 
  mean more to them than finding out the truth about God and His Son Jesus Christ. 
  They do not stop and look at the leader&#146;s character , the fruit on the 
  tree, and instead they follow wolves in sheep's clothing. (see Matthew 7, John 
  10, Acts 20 and 2 Peter). Those who are deceived in turn deceive others becoming 
  increasingly unstable. They are described as &quot;clouds&quot; and &quot;tossed 
  to and fro&quot; even downright bad &quot;with eyes full of adultery..&quot; 
  (see 2 Peter 2:12 and following for some colorful descriptions) The cure for 
  spiritual deception is to know and love God's Word, pursue truth, check basic 
  doctrine and character and to test the spirits as in 1 John 4:1-5.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Spiritual Inflation</i></p>
<p>This term &#147;spiritual inflation&#148; was coined by Carl Jung but has good 
  biblical antecedents. It describes the overpowering effect of suddenly encountering 
  the spiritual realm on certain individuals who had generally not encountered 
  much of the spiritual realm previously. Lacking a proper grounding in their 
  inner being for spiritual things they become totally carried away with notions 
  of spirituality. They almost seem to blow up like balloon, becoming overly obsessed 
  with &quot;being spiritual&quot;, and are often grandiose, clamorous, and frequently 
  pompous. Their utterances, which they esteem as being of great value, are generally 
  of dubious worth. An elegant and brief description is found in Colossians of 
  people who are &quot;puffed up&quot;. (In other words &quot;inflated&quot;!). 
  They are wordy but powerless. Saying they know more of Christ, they are actually 
  completely out of touch with Him. completely! They place their faith in &quot;what 
  they know&quot; about spiritual things &#150; which, according to Paul, indicates 
  they actually know nothing at all. For it is not knowledge that justifies but 
  faith working through love. Not infrequently they are also licentious in their 
  morality. The Corinthians also seem to also have had a problem with spiritual 
  inflation and were overly confident in their knowledge of spiritual things.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(Colossians 2:17-19 NKJV) {18} Let no one cheat you of your reward, taking 
  delight in false humility and worship of angels, intruding into those things 
  which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind, {19} and not holding 
  fast to the Head, from whom all the body, nourished and knit together by joints 
  and ligaments, grows with the increase that is from God.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1 Corinthians 4:17-20 NKJV) {19} But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord 
  wills, and I will know, not the word of those who are puffed up, but the power. 
  {20} For the kingdom of God is not in word but in power.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1 Corinthians 5:1-2 NKJV) It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality 
  among you, and such sexual immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles; 
  that a man has his father's wife! {2} And you are puffed up, and have not rather 
  mourned, that he who has done this deed might be taken away from among you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1 Corinthians 8:1-2 NKJV) Now concerning things offered to idols: We know 
  that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love edifies. {2} And if 
  anyone thinks that he knows anything, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Being Spiritually Enslaved To Rules And Regulations: </i>This is known as 
  a spirit of bondage and slavery: </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(Romans 8:15 NKJV) For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, 
  but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, &quot;Abba, Father.&quot;</p>
<p> </p>
<p> (Galatians 4:6-11 NKJV) And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit 
  of His Son into your hearts, crying out, &quot;Abba, Father!&quot; {7} Therefore 
  you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, then an heir of God through 
  Christ. {8} But then, indeed, when you did not know God, you served those which 
  by nature are not gods. {9} But now after you have known God, or rather are 
  known by God, how is it that you turn again to the weak and beggarly elements, 
  to which you desire again to be in bondage? {10} You observe days and months 
  and seasons and years. {11} I am afraid for you, lest I have labored for you 
  in vain.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The spirit of bondage is characterized by a desire to observe &quot;days and 
  months and seasons and years&quot; to take on aspects of the Law such as circumcision 
  and to be much concerned with dietary regulations and minor laws such as the 
  Sabbath. (Also see Colossians 2 and 1 Timothy 4 as well as all of Galatians). 
  This produces a sanctimonious rigidity. It also produces fear , &quot;the spirit 
  of bondage again to fear&#133;&quot; and a terror of trespassing in even quite 
  minor matters. This fear can be tremendously destabilizing and in my experience 
  full-blown phobias are not uncommon in children from legalistic backgrounds. 
  It is seen at its worst in victims of mind-control cults where flashbacks occur. 
  In people recovering from spiritual abuse and coming out of the &quot;spirit 
  of bondage&quot; quite biblical levels of freedom may feel sinful at first. 
  They nearly always have bouts of fear over &quot;breaking a rule&quot; no matter 
  how innocent - such as going to a G-rated family movie if all movies were previously 
  &quot;of the devil&quot;. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>A Spirit That Lacks Courage And Assertiveness:</i> Paul calls this is &quot;spirit 
  of fear&quot; and it is counteracted by stirring up the Spirit within you and 
  praying for boldness as the church did in Acts 4. It seems to be most common 
  when there is real danger and persecution and the temptation is to go easy on 
  preaching the gospel. Emotionally it produces the desire to back out of God's 
  clear calling on one's life and is a perspective of 'safety first&quot;.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2 Timothy 1:7 NKJV) For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power 
  and of love and of a sound mind.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(Acts 4:29-31NKJV) &quot;Now, Lord, look on their threats, and grant to Your 
  servants that with all boldness they may speak Your word, {30} &quot;by stretching 
  out Your hand to heal, and that signs and wonders may be done through the name 
  of Your holy Servant Jesus.&quot; {31} And when they had prayed, the place where 
  they were assembled together was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy 
  Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Timidity seems to have been Timothy's affliction and he is told at various 
  times to &quot;stir up&quot; the gift that was in him, not to let people despise 
  him, not to be fearful, to suffer hardship as a good soldier of Christ Jesus 
  and so forth. This exhortation seems to have worked because Timothy was there 
  through the last, and according to Hebrews even endured a bout of imprisonment 
  himself. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Other Spiritual Errors</b></p>
<p>Below are 22 references to the human spirit going &quot;out of true&quot; .In 
  each of them the person's perspective on life is deeply affected by their spiritual 
  affliction. In some cases a spirit of jealousy, in others of ill-will. Others 
  feel that they are poisoned in their spirit and bitterness colors their world. 
  Some references seem to be what we would call &quot;moods&quot; and some would 
  hesitate to attribute them to a spiritual cause. But the ancient Greeks - who 
  invented the term &quot;mood&quot; thought of moods as inspired and as the work 
  of the spiritual realm. They would even call on certain spirits when certain 
  moods were desired (see Theocritus &quot;Idylls&quot;). Moods resemble spirits 
  in that moods tend to come over us unbidden, dominate us for a while then leave 
  suddenly. There is thus some spiritual tie up between the human spirit and moods, 
  and that connection sometimes comes across in these verses. The human spirit 
  is complex and interacts with the person, with God and with the various entities 
  in the whole spiritual realm. [I will again duck and weave around the verses 
  below that mention the Lord sending an evil spirit on someone and just say &quot;Go 
  look up a commentary!&quot;. ]The point I want you to get is that our emotions 
  can flow from our human spirit which can go out of balance due to a wide variety 
  of factors (we will see four main ones) and that many of these discordant emotions 
  are grounded in our spiritual perspectives and out of balance perceptions. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>1. <i>A Spirit of Jealousy:</i> (Numbers 5:14 NKJV) 'if the spirit of jealousy 
  comes upon him and he becomes jealous of his wife, who has defiled herself; 
  or if the spirit of jealousy comes upon him and he becomes jealous of his wife, 
  although she has not defiled herself;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.<i> A Hardened And Obstinate Spirit:</i> (Deuteronomy 2:30 NKJV) &quot;But 
  Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass through, for the LORD your God hardened 
  his spirit and made his heart obstinate, that He might deliver him into your 
  hand, as it is this day.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3. <i>A Spirit Of Ill-Will:</i> (Judges 9:23 NKJV) God sent a spirit of ill

<p> </p>
<p>4.<i> A Sorrowful Spirit:</i> (1 Samuel 1:15 NKJV) And Hannah answered and 
  said, &quot;No, my lord, I am a woman of sorrowful spirit. I have drunk neither 
  wine nor intoxicating drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>5. <i>A Distressing Spirit :</i> (1 Samuel 16:14-16 NKJV) But the Spirit of 
  the LORD departed from Saul, and a distressing spirit from the LORD troubled 
  him. {15} And Saul's servants said to him, &quot;Surely, a distressing spirit 
  from God is troubling you. {16} &quot;Let our master now command your servants, 
  who are before you, to seek out a man who is a skillful player on the harp; 
  and it shall be that he will play it with his hand when the distressing spirit 
  from God is upon you, and you shall be well.&quot;&#133; And so it was, whenever 
  the spirit from God was upon Saul, that David would take a harp and play it 
  with his hand. Then Saul would become refreshed and well, and the distressing 
  spirit would depart from him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>6. <i>A Sullen Spirit: </i>(1 Kings 21:5 NKJV) But Jezebel his wife came to 
  him, and said to him, &quot;Why is your spirit so sullen that you eat no food?&quot;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>7.<i> A Poisoned Spirit : </i>(Job 6:4 NKJV) For the arrows of the Almighty

<p> </p>
<p>8.<i> An Anguished Spirit:</i> (Job 7:11 NKJV) &quot;Therefore I will not restrain

  are extinguished, The grave is ready for me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>11. <i>A Hasty And Compelling Spirit:</i> (Job 32:18 NKJV) For I am full of 
  words; The spirit within me compels me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>12. <i>An Unfaithful Spirit:</i> (Psalms 78:8 NKJV) And may not be like their 
  fathers, A stubborn and rebellious generation, A generation that did not set 
  its heart aright, And whose spirit was not faithful to God.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>13.<i> A Spirit That Is Overwhelmed By Troubles</i>:(Psalms 142:3 NKJV) When 
  my spirit was overwhelmed within me, Then You knew my path. In the way in which 
  I walk They have secretly set a snare for me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>14. <i>A Failing Spirit:</i> (Psalms 143:7 NKJV) Answer me speedily, O LORD; 
  My spirit fails! Do not hide Your face from me, Lest I be like those who go 
  down into the pit.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>18. <i>A Spirit Of Deep Sleep: </i>(Isaiah 29:10 NKJV) For the LORD has poured 
  out on you The spirit of deep sleep, And has closed your eyes, namely, the prophets; 
  And He has covered your heads, namely, the seers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>19. <i>An Errant Spirit: </i>(Isaiah 29:24 NKJV) These also who erred in spirit 
  will come to understanding, And those who complained will learn doctrine.&quot;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>20<i>. A Spirit of Heaviness: </i>(Isaiah 61:3 NKJV) To console those who mourn 
  in Zion, To give them beauty for ashes, The oil of joy for mourning, The garment

  The planting of the LORD, that He may be glorified.&quot;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>21. <i>A Grieved Spirit: </i>(Isaiah 65:14 NKJV) Behold, My servants shall 
  sing for joy of heart, But you shall cry for sorrow of heart, And wail for grief 
  of spirit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>22. <i>A Merely Human Spirit: </i>(Ezekiel 13:3 NKJV) Thus says the Lord GOD: 
  &quot;Woe to the foolish prophets, who follow their own spirit and have seen 
  nothing!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This biblical data may be uncomfortable for many from overly rational backgrounds. 
  However the realm of the human spirit needs to be explored if we are to understand 
  the human person. After all our spirit is the deepest part of us. Without getting 
  lost in all the details lets see if we can draw out a handful of general principles:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&middot; The human spirit has a vast emotional range. It is not a cool, analytical, 
  emotionless part of the human person. In fact the spirit generates the deepest 
  and most powerful emotions we know.</p>
<p>&middot; A person's fundamental outlook on life flows from their spirit and 
  when the spirit is affected this affects the actions of the whole person. </p>
<p>&middot; The spirit is vulnerable and can be damaged. Traumatic life circumstances 
  and intense suffering can break the spirit or cause it to be overwhelmed.</p>
<p>&middot; The person has some degree of control over their spirit, and this 
  is a good and desirable thing. A person who lacks control over their spirit 
  has trouble with maintaining proper boundaries. (Proverbs 25:28)</p>
<p>&middot; The human spiritual realm is subject to change. Moods seem to be linked 
  to a temporary state of the human spirit. </p>
<p>&middot; God can cause both positive and negative changes in the human spirit. 
  In Isaiah from a spirit of heaviness is changed into a garment of praise. In 
  the case of King Saul he moves from being anointed with the Holy Spirit to being 
  tormented by a distressing spirit. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>The Four Causes Of Problems With The Human Spirit</b></p>
<p>To mine the biblical data above a bit further I have found the above list of 
  spiritual problems can be put into four fundamental categories based on what 
  causes them. The four main causes of problems with the human spirit are &#150; 
  sin, folly, trauma and spiritual attack. Each of these can affect our most basic 
  perceptions of ourselves, life, others and God and lead to emotional discordance. 
  By understanding these four causes we will be able to frame a wise and appropriate 
  response as we minister the grace of God.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b><i>Problems Caused By Sin</i></b><br>
  Firstly there are those spiritual problems based on sin - such as the &quot;haughty 
  spirit&quot; described above which flows from the sin of pride, and affects 
  our perceptions of others. The others in this category is &#147;a spirit turned 
  against God&#148;, which flows from the sin of rebellion, and affects our perception 
  of God. </p>
<p>All of us sin but this is different. This is much deeper. Here the sin has 
  got right down to the deepest level of the personality and gained a stronghold. 
  In these cases the human spirit itself has been captured or defiled by a particular 
  sin. Pride or rebellion has become deeply ingrained in the person&#146;s nature 
  and now affects their entire outlook on life. When our own inner spirit has 
  become allied with either of these sins the only cure is deep repentance, confession 
  and restoration. God repeatedly engineers painful circumstances in our lives 
  until we realize the great hold such sins can have on us. </p>
<p>A third and special case of this is where the sin is the sin of unbelief concerning 
  Christ in which case repentance and faith leads to conversion. Christian approaches 
  that are repentance based and helpful here include: Jay E. Adams' Nouthetic 
  Counseling, and Alcoholics Anonymous.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Indications Of When Sin Has Deeply Affected The Human Spirit :</p>
<p>Where there is a deep love of, or blindness to, clearly and obviously sinful 
  behavior such as that in the sin lists in Paul's epistles. <br>
  Celebration of lawlessness, defiance of rules and authority. Rebellion. ( 1John 
  3:4) <br>
  Glorying in unrighteous scheming. (Prov 24:9) <br>
  A deep spiritual obstinacy. Consistently knowing the right thing to do and refusing 
  to do it. (James 4:17) <br>
  A faithless and violated conscience. Habitually doing things contrary to one's 
  faith. (Romans 14:23) <br>
</p>
<p>Dealing With Sins Of The Spirit:</p>
<p>The course here is fairly well known. Awaken the person to their sin, then 
  ask them to repent from their sin and to confess it to God and to make restoration 
  where practical. Repentance involves a turning around from the wrong behavior 
  or attitude to the right behavior or attitude. </p>
<p>(Isaiah 55:7 NKJV) Let the wicked forsake his way, And the unrighteous man 
  his thoughts; Let him return to the LORD, And He will have mercy on him; And 
  to our God, For He will abundantly pardon.</p>
<p>Wrong ways are to be forsaken and an unrighteous thought life is to be put 
  aside. Sin is not just confessed, it is also left behind. Awakening the person 
  to their sin may be a difficult process and may even require some confrontation 
  by the elders of the church. This should not be done lightly and the proper 
  procedure is outlined in Matthew 18.15-20. The seriousness with which the apostle 
  Paul took church discipline and its severity is almost unknown in the modern 
  church (see 1 Corinthians 5 and 2 Corinthians 12 &amp; 13). Above all pray that 
  the Holy Spirit will help you help the sinner and will provide both the conviction 
  of sin and the grace and power for change.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b><i>Problems Caused By Folly</i></b><br>
  Secondly there are those spiritual problems based on folly in the human spirit. 
  This is an abiding disposition of foolishness rather than just a one-off mistake. 
  People characterized by folly in their human spirit demonstrate a nature lacking 
  in personal insight and basic wisdom. They are unbalanced and unwise and unable 
  to rightly judge themselves or others. A foolish person lacks wisdom in one 
  or more key areas of their life and makes the same mistakes over and over again. 
  They are frequently stubborn and unteachable and education is of little avail 
  until the errant spirit is fixed. </p>
<p>They seem to need discipline combined with a sudden transforming work of God 
  that corrects the spiritual damage at the root of their folly. Once the error 
  in their spirit is corrected and wisdom flows a whole major aspect of their 
  character can instantly change. There is frequently a moment of realization 
  when light dawns and they say &quot;how could I have been so dumb!&quot;. Among 
  them are those having an errant spirit, a perverse spirit, a hasty spirit, a 
  sullen spirit, and an inappropriate spirit of jealousy as described in the bible 
  passages above. </p>
<p>Proverbs describes a range of foolish people such as the na&iuml;ve, the young 
  men seduced by a harlot, the unteachable fool, the lazy sluggard, the scoffer, 
  the person wise in their own eyes and the boorish fool. For these people loving 
  discipline, fervent believing prayer for wisdom (James 1:5), good scriptural 
  teaching and high quality ongoing discipleship may help correct the error in 
  their spirit. Christian approaches that have proved helpful here include: Neil 
  T. Anderson's truth encounters and various discipleship strategies, church discipline 
  and accountability groups. Many men's ministries specialize in this approach. 
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Indications of when folly has overtaken the human spirit:</p>
<p>&middot; When the person consistently makes unwise choices that are not so 
  much &quot;bad&quot; as &quot;just real dumb&quot;. They are characterized by 
  an almost total lack of insight about themselves, their lifestyle and other 
  people..</p>
<p>&middot; Where they are na&iuml;ve, credulous, gullible or always falling in 
  love.</p>
<p>&middot; A deeply derisive attitude to education, knowledge and learning and 
  wisdom.</p>
<p>&middot; They constantly show off their knowledge but do not listen to others 
  and are quite unteachable.</p>
<p>&middot; Foolish habits, erratic behavior, impulsiveness, wild schemes, dreaming, 
  loud inappropriate and boorish behavior, lack of insight, poor decisions.</p>
<p>&middot; The person does not set out to be immoral but finds themselves being 
  easily caught up in immoral relationships or they seem unable to avoid bad company.</p>
<p>&middot; Where a person is chronically lazy, slack and disorganized and their 
  life drifts from job to job and failure to failure, when there is a great sense 
  of wasted potential.</p>
<p>&middot; Poor and very inappropriate communication such as boastfulness, an 
  inability to listen or be corrected, hasty speech, quick displays of anger and 
  provocation and little idea of how to be socially appropriate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dealing With Folly In The Human Spirit </p>
<p>As we saw in previous chapters wisdom is closely associated with the presence 
  and teaching ministry of the Holy Spirit. Wisdom can be prayed for and is prayed 
  for by Paul. James is quite specific in saying that a Christian can receive 
  wisdom from God directly through prayer (James 1:5) This wisdom can be in ordinary 
  daily things where wisdom may be lacking. An interesting passage that illustrates 
  this is found in Isaiah 28:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(Isaiah 28:23-29 NKJV) Give ear and hear my voice, Listen and hear my speech. 
  {24} Does the plowman keep plowing all day to sow? Does he keep turning his 
  soil and breaking the clods? {25} When he has leveled its surface, Does he not 
  sow the black cummin And scatter the cummin, Plant the wheat in rows, The barley 
  in the appointed place, And the spelt in its place? {26} For He instructs him 
  in right judgment, His God teaches him. {27} For the black cummin is not threshed 
  with a threshing sledge, Nor is a cartwheel rolled over the cummin; But the 
  black cummin is beaten out with a stick, And the cummin with a rod. {28} Bread 
  flour must be ground; Therefore he does not thresh it forever, Break it with 
  his cartwheel, Or crush it with his horsemen. {29} This also comes from the 
  LORD of hosts, Who is wonderful in counsel and excellent in guidance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>God guides and instructs the farmer in the humble daily routines of farming! 
  God is thus concerned with our work as well as with our religion. It is His 
  will for us to have wisdom in all aspects of our lives. This confidence that 
  God loves to instruct His people should give us great hope when dealing with 
  foolish Christians. It gives us a solid basis for prayer when we ask Him to 
  give wisdom to those who lack it. He delights to do this and James says He gives 
  &#145;without reproach&#148;. (James 1:5-8)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Foolish Christians first need to realize they have been foolish. Once the light 
  dawns they need to be encouraged to seek wisdom from God. Finally they need 
  to learn the basic disciplines that will enable them to correct their folly 
  in the light of their new wisdom. This process takes place best in a Christian 
  community where accountability and discipleship are lovingly practiced without 
  harshness or legalism. [See the chapter on Learning Organizations later in this 
  book]. In such communities personal change is normal and others around them 
  are also working on aspects of their character. Support groups, bible study 
  groups, one to one discipleship sessions, counseling and Christian communities 
  all provide good contexts for the correction of folly in the life of the Christian.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>However awakening a person to the fact that their behavior is foolish is not 
  easy. Pain is the great awakener as well as honest and true Christian friends 
  who speak the truth in love. One method that can work is to get a person to 
  write out in a journal the consequences of the behavior you are trying to get 
  them to correct. Then get them to do a cost-benefit analysis. This has awakened 
  many gamblers once they have honestly done a calculation of the cost of their 
  habit. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some people know they are foolish but have no idea how to change. If you want 
  to lead someone from folly to wisdom be prepared to provide careful, detailed 
  step by step instruction and modeling. Going from folly to wisdom involves learning 
  and learning requires a good and patient teacher. Do not dump a whole heap of 
  demands and ideas on people. Give them bite-sized bits of counseling homework 
  and encourage every step of improvement. As I mentioned earlier sometimes wisdom 
  can arrive from God in answer to godly believing prayer. When it does it sometimes 
  comes in a rush, in a huge &quot;Aha&quot; moment the person sees what they 
  should have seen all along and suddenly changes. This is good, but a good structure 
  of discipleship and the careful systematic teaching of biblical truth can help 
  those moments to occur with greater frequency.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b><i>Problems Caused By Trauma</i></b><br>
  Thirdly there are those spiritual problems based on the effects of suffering 
  or trauma. For such people the trauma of life has been so deep and so overwhelming 
  that it has affected their human spirit. These people literally have a damaged 
  spirit, which is in need of healing or comfort. The spirit of such people can 
  be described as broken, failing, poisoned, overwhelmed, grieved or anguished. 
</p>
<p>This damage to the human spirit is far beyond the normal upsets of life and 
  is a deep and personal wound such as those inflicted by rape, violent crime, 
  death, divorce, deep injustice, cult involvement and torture. For these people 
  there needs to be prayer ministry and an atmosphere of gentle encouragement. 
  In some cases the damage may be so profound that the person has an &quot;uncontrolled 
  spirit&quot; and is like a city with broken down walls - easily exploited, and 
  easily manipulated. Such people will need much rebuilding of the walls and instructions 
  in setting appropriate personal boundaries. For many damaged people the biblical 
  truths that give hope and grace may need to be repeated often in an atmosphere 
  of love, encouragement and healing prayer. Counselors operating in this area 
  have to be especially gentle and caring and able to spend hours in healing prayer 
  with a single client. Christian and Christian-compatible approaches that have 
  proved helpful here include: Healing of the memories, inner healing, Theophostic 
  counseling, many retreat centers and prayer ministries, Bradshaws&#146;s championing 
  the inner child, etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Indications of trauma having affected the human spirit:</p>
<p>&middot; A distinct event that precipitated the problem.</p>
<p>&middot; Painful emotions such as grief, bitterness and sorrow.</p>
<p>&middot; Flashbacks, problems with memory.</p>
<p>&middot; The person is overwhelmed by life, fearful, or consumed with anxiety.</p>
<p>&middot; The person indicates they feel they are emotionally crippled and &quot;lame&quot;. 
</p>
<p>&middot; The person communicates that they are broken or damaged inside.</p>
<p>&middot; The person pulls away from life and indicates a deep need for comfort 
  and healing, space and privacy, gentleness and restoration.</p>
<p>&middot; As you talk to someone you get the sense that you are dealing with 
  both an adult and a damaged child in the same person.</p>
<p>&middot; Unusual reactions to normal stimuli. A sense that the person is reacting 
  inappropriately because some wound is being touched.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dealing With People Whose Spirit Has Been Affected By Trauma <br>
  Go slowly and go gently. Traumatized people need care and comfort and support 
  because life has already overwhelmed them. Dealing with severely traumatized 
  people should be left to trained professionals. However many people can be helped 
  and many ordinary Christians restored by appropriate and gentle prayer ministry 
  and healing of the memories. One of the better Christian approaches is Theophostics 
  (its not as New Age as the name sounds) by Dr. Ed Smith of Kentucky. David Seamands 
  has also done good work with his &quot;Healing Of The Memories&quot; and &quot;Healing 
  For Damaged Emotions&quot;. Of secular approaches John Bradshaw's &quot;championing 
  the inner child&quot; is among the better ones and is worth a read by those 
  involved in ministry. A lot of research is now being done on Post-Traumatic 
  Stress Disorder and on Multiple Personality Disorder which I believe are extreme 
  forms of having a damaged and broken spirit. So you can see that this is a huge 
  and specialized area in which a great deal of research is currently being undertaken 
  and which is quite impossible top cover in a few hundred words in this chapter. 
  What can we do then? </p>
<p>1. Be supportive, understanding, loving and caring. Give the person lots of 
  freedom. Let them be angry but don&#146;t let them dwell too long on it. </p>
<p>2. Be extremely patient, do not condemn, do not censure. They are bruised and 
  hurting. Remember &quot;a bruised reed He will not break and a sputtering wick 
  He will not extinguish.&quot;</p>
<p>3. Avoid strong emotion. A gentle quite retreat atmosphere is generally far 
  more healing for trauma than a hyped up evangelistic meeting. There is so much 
  strong emotion inside them that they are already overloaded emotionally. Part 
  of healing is to decrease this overloaded emotional level.</p>
<p>4. Above all do not suggest to them how they may have been abused or attempt 
  to recover memories. False memory syndrome induced by zealous counselors is 
  very real and very damaging.</p>
<p>5. Where necessary help them seek justice. Empower them to go to the police 
  and through the court system. Many Christians are uncomfortable with this but 
  people need to feel supported and protected and that there is justice in the 
  world. If the offender is hardened and unrepentant and a continuing risk to 
  the community then that offender should not be protected by &quot;gracious&quot; 
  Christians. I faced this dilemma when I knew that a schoolteacher was a serial 
  pedophile, lacked insight into his condition and was still around young children. 
  He went to jail for eight years. The victims agreed with this course of action 
  and were benefited by it. </p>
<p>6. If they are agreeable pray for them and soak them in loving prayer. Do not 
  expect or demand immediate miraculous outcomes. Just soak them in prayer and 
  let them slowly come face to face with Jesus who heals them. Repeat as necessary.</p>
<p>7. Encourage them to seek God's Presence in prayer and worship. Do not censure 
  them for seeking God in ways that are outside your personal religious tradition. 
  Many evangelicals are disturbed when a recovering person spends time reading 
  the mystical writers or sets up a chapel at home with a cross and a candle. 
  Remember that the spirit is a world of symbols and they are trying to reconstruct 
  their symbolic realm. This is a complex task - let them be.</p>
<p>8. Encourage them to express their feelings via art, acting, music, poetry, 
  writing, pottery, crafts, gardening, keeping pets and other non-destructive 
  outlets.</p>
<p>9. Don't argue but do gently correct false perspectives on life. Much of the 
  continuing damage comes from believing untruths about God, self or others. These 
  need to be gently shown to be false and the person shown who they are in Christ 
  and in the loving eyes of God.</p>
<p>10. Give them lots and lots of time to heal and realize that recovery from 
  trauma may happen in bits and pieces over many years. Don't feel it has to be 
  fixed right now. Let God heal them in God's time.</p>
<p>If you are someone that feels that you may have a broken and damaged spirit 
  do not sit alone and try to heal yourself. You need grace and you need special 
  people and places that have a healing effect on the emotionally damaged. Ask 
  the Lord to lead you to the right people and places where you can find the grace 
  you need.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b><i>Problems Caused By Spiritual Attack</i></b><br>
  Fourthly there are those spiritual problems which are the outcome of a spiritual 
  attack that has affected the human spirit. For mostly Christians this is just 
  harassment of the believer by an evil spirit external to them. For some people 
  particularly those involved in the occult or grave sexual sin, exorcism may 
  be necessary. For simplicity I will break spiritual attacks into two categories: 
  minor attacks which are generally attacks on our mood, and major attacks that 
  go deep into the spirit and involve a major change in consciousness observable 
  to others. </p>
<p>The classic mood attacks are the suddenly swinging moods of King Saul who was 
  afflicted by an evil spirit. These dark and evil moods often accuse the person, 
  others or God and produce hopelessness, despair and discouragement.. They can 
  also suddenly give rise to lurid and vivid temptations or can fuel abiding anger 
  and cause an irrational &quot;spirit of ill-will&quot; to develop. These moods 
  have the following characteristics:</p>
<p>&middot; They come over the person without warning.</p>
<p>&middot; They then control their thinking and emotions for a while and take 
  it in a negative direction.</p>
<p>&middot; They leave suddenly when rebuked in the name of Jesus</p>
<p>&middot; They sometimes can be assuaged by Christian music such as when David 
  played his psalms on the harp for Saul.</p>
<p>Please note carefully the above mood &quot;attacks&quot; are not the same as 
  &quot;demon possession&quot;! In mood attacks the attacking spiritual entity 
  is external to the believer and is engaged in harassment of the believer through 
  their thoughts and emotions. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Other indications of spiritual attack on the human spirit include:</p>
<p>The sudden desire to give up the ministry or the faith. <br>
  Dislike to the point of hostility regarding the bible, prayer or communion. 
  <br>
  Sharp painful feelings, doubts from nowhere, accusations of God, self or others. 
  Fiery darts. <br>
  A floating seductive feeling that takes over the consciousness and blots out 
  prayer. <br>
  Altered states of consciousness in which sinful acts are performed. <br>
  The evident presence of an evil spirit. Manifestations, voices etc. <br>
  A preoccupation with strange doctrines or bizarre dietary practices. <br>
  Involvement in the occult, death metal music, pornography, drugs, or Eastern 
  religion. <br>
</p>
<p>Major attacks are where the consciousness of the person is greatly altered 
  and it is evident that the person&#146;s human spirit has been invaded in some 
  way.. A second personality or consciousness may take over the person and speak 
  in a different voice or the person may suddenly enter a trance state (which 
  is often rather sweet and seductive) and which obliterates all moral consciousness. 
  In this trance state the person may perform sinful actions of which they later 
  have reduced or blurry recollection. In such cases exorcism by an experienced 
  practitioner who has the recommendation of sensible and mature Christians may 
  be called for.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dealing With Spiritual Attacks</p>
<p>.Here is a general formula for dealing with minor spiritual attacks on the 
  Christians emotional life:</p>
<p>&middot; Become aware that it may be an attack of the Devil. </p>
<p>&middot; Try and give it a name if you can e.g. &quot;a mood of deep discouragement&quot;.</p>
<p>&middot; Resist its effects on you and say a firm &quot;No' to its lies and 
  suggestions. </p>
<p>&middot; If necessary counter its lies with the truth of Scripture or just 
  plain facts. When Elijah was deeply discouraged and said &quot;I alone am left&quot; 
  God just said &quot;I have 7000 that have not bowed the knee to Baal&quot; (1 
  Kings 19).</p>
<p>&middot; Rebuke the harassing spirit sternly in the name of Jesus with the 
  spiritual authority you have as a believer. (see Ephesians 1:20, 2:6, Colossians 
  2:13-15, Matthew 11:11-13)</p>
<p>&middot; It should leave virtually instantly. If it tries another bout later 
  on - then rebuke it again.</p>
<p>&middot; If it returns you may have given ground to it by nurturing resentment 
  or hatred, or actually liking the vivid temptations or believing there might 
  be some truth in the accusations If this is the case then remove the ground 
  the Devil is using to afflict you by repenting of your wrong attitude and then 
  exercising forgiveness towards others. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When is exorcism necessary? </p>
<p>When there is clear evidence of an indwelling evil spirit. These indications 
  include changes in personality such as a male person talking with a female voice 
  or vice versa. They also include various peculiar odors and bizarre manifestations 
  that are quite uncharacteristic of the person; a strong aversion to prayer and 
  spiritual disciplines and especially to communion and an attraction to unclean 
  behavior. Some people are overwhelmed by sinful obsessions and compulsions (unlike 
  in obsessive-compulsive disorder where the obsessions are generally morally 
  neutral acts such as hand-washing or locking up repeatedly) and unusual trance 
  states where sinful acts are performed including a compulsion to suicide and 
  dark obsessions. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before engaging in exorcism make sure you are aware of your authority in Christ 
  over the demonic realm. See the following verses Luke 10:19, 1 John 5:18,19; 
  Ephesians 1:20, 2:6, Colossians 2:13-15, Matthew 11:11-13, Hebrews 1:14, and 
  1 Corinthians 6:1-3 and any good and reasonably recent systematic theology. 
  You should also consult some of the books on deliverance ministry recommended 
  in the section below. It is best to learn the art of exorcism from an experienced, 
  wise and balanced practitioner who can show you how to go about it sensibly 
  and effectively. Now to consider a special kind of spiritual attack - curses.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b><i>Curses</i></b></p>
<p>Curses are an unusual topic for a book on emotions, but they are real, and 
  are profoundly emotionally disturbing for those who experience them. They are 
  not just angry words or swear words; they are acts of power in the spiritual 
  real. Curses are mentioned over 200 times in Scripture, and were foundational 
  to the Old Covenant (see Deuteronomy 28-30). God Himself was the first one to 
  pronounce curses &#150; on the earth, on Eve&#146;s fertility and upon the serpent. 
  Curses are not just a primitive superstition; they are spiritual pronouncements 
  recorded in Scripture, that profoundly affect the very structure of reality 
  in some way. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The world was created by the word of God and is held together by the power 
  of His Word (Genesis 1, Hebrews 1:1-3, Colossians 1:17-20). Thus God&#146;s 
  words can change creation and Jesus&#146; curse caused the fig-tree, representing 
  barren Israel, to shrivel up. Blessings and curses are first of all God&#146;s 
  words that operate at this fundamental level of creation and &#147;tilt the 
  playing field&#148; of life one way or another. Secondly curses and blessings 
  can be from evil spirits or flow from the human spirit. Goliaths curses against 
  David were &#147;by his gods&#148; (1 Samuel 17:43) and were ineffective for 
  reasons we shall see later. The David and Goliath encounter was a power encounter 
  of one spiritual system against the other and both contenders came in the name 
  of their respective deities. Shamans and magicians such as Balaam were hired 
  to curse people in OT times and still do this today. Though curses from evil 
  sources much less powerful than curses from God they still were feared and were 
  able to do much damage. There are 22 references exhorting believers not to curse 
  others. Curses are finally ended in the new creation (Rev 22:3).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The origin of blessings and curses is found in the book of Genesis. The first 
  blessing is upon the living creatures, which were told to &#147;be fruitful 
  and multiply&#148; (Genesis 1:22). When God made mankind He also blessed them 
  saying &#147;be fruitful and multiply&#148; and added a third blessing &#147;have 
  dominion over&#148; (Genesis 1:28). These three basic blessings of: &#147;be 
  fruitful&#148;, &#147;multiply&#148; and &#147;have dominion over&#148; form 
  the basis of all future blessings, such as the Abrahamic blessings, and their 
  reversal forms the basis of all future curses such as those in Genesis 3. Lets 
  look at this a little bit further:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fruitfulness is the ability to joyfully express your inner nature and feel 
  that which you are doing is truly creative, worthwhile and significant. Its 
  opposite is pain in creation especially barrenness. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Multiplication is exponential increase - increasing as in 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 
  64, 128 not additively as in 2 , 4, 6, 8, 10, Multiplication is a huge increase 
  in productivity for a small increase in effort. Its opposite is frustration 
  and futility. Putting in a huge effort for little or no reward. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Authority to rule over means dignity, headship, authority, the ability to be 
  ascendant, to be the head not the tail. Its opposite is being humbled, to eat 
  the dirt, to be crushed and humiliated, to be unable to rise. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Genesis 3 we see the first curses in operation. The woman is made unfruitful, 
  the man is made to work in futility and the serpent is told he will eat the 
  dirt. The three things that make life good are reversed. Life becomes unbearable. 
  Thus when we are cursed we find life very difficult indeed. No matter how hard 
  we try to rise we never quite make it. Time and time we get to the brink of 
  success only to have it snatched away. Curses can affect health, particularly 
  reproductive health. They can affect earning power and they can affect our ability 
  to have authority and command over our lives and people who are cursed may have 
  to endure life-long humiliation. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a missionary I can say that curses are real and in some cases they are even 
  lethal; Ezekiel talks of magic charms that hunted lives (Ezekiel 13:18-20). 
  Curses are on the rise in Western culture as people dabble more and more in 
  the occult and in organizations where people take secret oaths that invoke curses 
  (such as the Masons). Emotionally curses produce deep confusion and despair 
  and an inability to think straight. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>[There is not a lot of good literature on the topic of curses and all such 
  books need to be read critically and subjective material carefully evaluated. 
  Derek Prince&#146;s book &#147;Curses and Blessings&#148; is reasonable, Ed 
  Murphy&#146;s chapter is good but gives no hint on how to break curses, and 
  Francis Frangipane has some very good books on living in the place of protection 
  from curses and spiritual attack.] </p>
<p> </p>
<p>On one hand we do want to acknowledge the reality of curses and to deal with 
  them and to break them on the other hand we do not want to become overly superstitious 
  and fearful seeing curses everywhere. If your life is affected by sterility, 
  barrenness, constant lack of success and failure to gain any sort of ascendancy 
  no matter how hard you try then a curse may be in operation. If you think this 
  may be the case then do some research on your life and family history and take 
  the matter before the Lord. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The good news is that breaking curses can be surprisingly easy for Christians 
  because we dwell under the protection of the blood of Jesus Christ. Curses have 
  greatest power where the person who has been cursed has committed some great 
  act of wickedness such as involvement in the occult. The reverse is also true, 
  curses have little or no power over a righteous person and Proverbs says that 
  a curse without cause will not alight on the head of a righteous man.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Scripture reveals a number of ways in which we can break curses and/or be protected 
  from them</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1) Live a righteous life free from major sin and acts of injustice. Abide in 
  the righteousness of Christ where no curse can penetrate. (Malachi 4:6, Proverbs 
  26:2, Romans 8).</p>
<p>2) Put on the full armor of God in Ephesians 6 :10-21 which is actually armor 
  against spiritual attack. Ephesus was noted for its magic practices (Acts 19) 
  and its curses and witchcraft. The primary purpose behind Paul writing to the 
  Ephesians was so they could have some understanding of their power, authority 
  and degree of protection in their pagan and occult city. The armor of God is 
  like the Kevlar of the spirit world protecting the Christian against curses, 
  magic and occult practices.</p>
<p>3) God is able to turn a curse into a blessing. He did this when Balak tried 
  to get Baalam to curse Israel. (Nehemiah 13:2, Deuteronomy 23:5, Numbers 22&amp;23). 
  A brief prayer by Jabez that has received a lot of popularity lately is a case 
  of a person appealing to God to have a curse turned into a blessing and succeeding. 
  David is particularly bold when he says in Psalm 109 where he seems to have 
  been the victim of a curse (see verses 17 &amp; 18) (Psalms 109:28 NKJV) Let 
  them curse, but You bless; When they arise, let them be ashamed, But let Your 
  servant rejoice. David did not fear the curse, but instead asked God to bless 
  him and outdo the curse, and then to turn the curse back on those who uttered 
  it. God can out-bless the most fearsome and disabling curses. It gives us hope 
  that our prayers to God based on the name of Jesus can not only break curses 
  but have them turned into blessings instead.</p>
<p>4) Understand and plead the fact that Christ has taken all the curses due to 
  us when He became a curse on the cross (Galatians 3:10-14). In Christ that ground 
  for curses to succeed against us is removed because on the cross Jesus became 
  a curse for us and took all the cursing that may have been due to us due to 
  our violation of God's laws.</p>
<p>5) Break associations with the sins of parents and ancestors particularly those 
  involving the occult or idolatry. Exodus 34:6,7 says such sins bring a curse 
  &quot;to the third and fourth generation&quot;. We have to break ties with such 
  sins by not participating in occult ceremonies that may be traditional and even 
  confessing such involvement of your parents and ancestors and forsaking them 
  in a prayer of renunciation to God. The essential thing is to make a clear break 
  with the familial sin in your own heart, mind and spirit. </p>
<p>6) Get rid of objects that bring a curse particularly objects associated with 
  pagan worship, idolatry or the occult. For instance if we have our Grandmothers 
  pack of tarot cards we need to get rid of them. (Deuteronomy 7:25,26) The Ephesian 
  converts were moved by the Holy Spirit to burn their magic scrolls and occult 
  objects. (Acts 19:18-20).</p>
<p>7) Do not engage in secretive or dishonest sins that you think you can get 
  away with unobserved. In Deuteronomy 27: 15-26 certain sins are singled out 
  as bringing a curse notably the making of idols, incest, bestiality, treating 
  parents with contempt, injustice against migrants, widows, the disabled or the 
  poor, hiring a contract killer, and moving your neighbors landmark or boundary 
  stone. Most of these are crimes that would never be tried in court because of 
  the secret nature of the crimes, the lack of two or three eye witnesses willing 
  to testify or the difficulty of proving of the case such as the &#147;my word 
  against yours&#146; case of the boundary stone. The curse was God&#146;s way 
  of making sure that such secret crimes did not go unpunished. People knew that 
  if they did these things God would repay. Even in the New Testament God is referred 
  to as the one who punishes those who defile the marriage bed. (1 Thessalonians 
  4:4-6, Hebrews 13:4). If you have done any of the things in the above list then 
  repentance, restoration and an earnest appeal to God for mercy would be a good 
  starting point in breaking the curse over your life.</p>
<p>8) Curses can alight where there is deep abiding injustice against an ethnic 
  group. Saul&#146;s bloodthirsty massacre of the Gibeonites, which lay uncorrected 
  for years, later resulted in a curse and a famine in the time of David.</p>
<p>(2 Samuel 21:1 NKJV) Now there was a famine in the days of David for three 
  years, year after year; and David inquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, 
  &quot;It is because of Saul and his bloodthirsty house, because he killed the 
  Gibeonites.&quot;</p>
<p>David broke this curse by going back to the offended ethnic group, humbly asking 
  how they would like to see justice done and then enacting it. After ten of Saul&#146;s 
  sons were hung the famine ended. (2 Samuel 21:1-14). </p>
<p>9) Slackness in ministry can result in a curse. The priests in Malachi were 
  under a curse because of their slackness in God's work (Malachi 2:2 ) and the 
  prophet Jeremiah cries out &quot;cursed be he who is slack in doing the Lord's 
  work (Jeremiah 48:10). If you are in ministry do the work of the Lord diligently 
  and obey His specific instructions if you have been given such instructions. 
</p>
<p>10) Put God&#146;s interests ahead of your own. In the book of Haggai God puts 
  a curse on the nation (Haggai 1:5-11, 2:16,17 )for being self-centered and neglectful 
  of their duty to God. The curse is removed when the people obey the prophets 
  and lay the foundation on the Lord's temple (Haggai 2:18,19) and a blessing 
  is given instead. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are over 200 verses on curses in Scripture and the above list just touches 
  on some of the main causes and their remedies. Basically a curse can only alight 
  on an area that God has already judged as being worthy of a curse &#150; such 
  as incest , idolatry or murder. Most curses generally last only 3-4 generations 
  though some have lasted since Creation. Repentance from sin, breaking ties with 
  the occult and taking refuge in Christ who has become a curse for us are the 
  main strategies we can use to break curses. Part of this is putting on the whole 
  armor of God, which is designed to protect us from curses leveled against us 
  in the course of spiritual warfare (Ephesians 6:10-18). When the curse is lifted 
  then the human spirit that has been affected by the curse and been bowed down 
  with pain, confusion and futility will be quickly healed. The person will recover 
  and emotional normality should soon follow.</p>

<p><b>References On Deliverance Ministry and Spiritual Warfare</b></p>
<p>There are no perfect books on this difficult topic but there are many good 
  and useful books on deliverance ministry in most Christian bookstores. Among 
  the better ones I recommend Ed Murphy's &quot;Handbook of Spiritual Warfare&quot; 
  and the writings of Francis Frangipane, George Otis Jr. , John Wimber and C. 
  Peter Wagner . Classics on spiritual warfare include &quot;Born For Battle&quot; 
  by R. Arthur Matthews and &quot;Screwtape Letters&quot; by C. S. Lewis . My 
  e-book &quot;Praying To Move Mountains&quot; available from www.eternitymagazine.com 
  has some short articles on the topic, and its free. Books to avoid are those 
  written by conspiracy theorists or which sensationalize the topic. Especially 
  be wary of books that &quot;see a demon under every bush&quot; or which place 
  a great deal of credence on the testimony of demons being exorcised or which 
  have extensive lists of behaviors that are supposed to get you demonized (especially 
  if the behaviors are not listed as sinful in Scripture). Such books can bring 
  people into legalism and bondage. God has made us to be aware of spiritual attacks 
  and to have victory over them but not to be preoccupied with them, fearful or 
  overly suspicious. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Concluding This Chapter</b></p>
<p>Our life perspective may be affected by a wide range of events that damage 
  our human spirit, so that it cannot see God or life correctly. This damage tilts 
  our basic perception of reality so that the whole of life, including our emotional 
  life, is dysfunctional. Our human spirit can be deceived or brought into spiritual 
  captivity and bondage by false teaching or damaged through sin, folly, trauma 
  or spiritual attack. Curses can bring immense emotional pain and a feeling of 
  constant struggle and futility. All of the above have scriptural remedies and 
  can be dealt with and fixed. They are not necessarily permanent. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As they are fixed our human spirit will begin to function as it is meant to 
  function. That is as the place in us that receives God&#146;s truth and God&#146;s 
  wisdom and which works in co-operation with the Holy Spirit. As our human spirit 
  heals our spiritual sensitivity will increase and we will see ourselves, others 
  and God rightly. When this occurs the process of co-operating with the Holy 
  Spirit to become Christ-like emotionally is made much easier.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once our perception of life and basic stance on life is relatively OK we can 
  then go on to create a more functional belief system. This will in turn help 
  us to be stable emotionally as much of our emotional reactivity flows from what 
  we believe is happening to us and our explicit, verbal, beliefs that we hear 
  as &quot;self-talk&quot;. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once a person afflicted by a bitter and broken human spirit is healed they 
  will no longer be bitter and broken. They will have a much better outlook on 
  life and see themselves, others and God in a much more gracious light. However 
  that dark and bitter period of life may have formed certain beliefs in them 
  that have not yet changed. Hence the next chapter is on constructing a fully 
  Christian and emotionally healthy belief system. </p>
