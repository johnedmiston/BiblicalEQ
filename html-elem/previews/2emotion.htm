  <b>What Kind Of Emotions Should Christians Have?</b><br>
  While God is emotional there are some emotions that God never has. God is never 
  envious, lustful, greedy, bitter with selfish ambition, small-minded, or petty. 
  Neither is he anxious or fretful but dwells in perfect peace. His emotions are 
  positive, holy, noble and appropriate. God is light and in Him there is no darkness 
  at all. Since we are called to be &#147;in the image of God&#148;, then whatever 
  else that means, it means that at the end of our Christian maturity, our emotions 
  should in some measure share these divine qualities. We should be &#147;walking 
  in the light&#148;. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thus godliness means forsaking some emotions and embracing others. We should 
  be utterly free from unholy and fleshly emotions and moving toward mature and 
  holy emotional responses. The mature saint of God is filled with love and utterly 
  free from bitter envy and selfish ambition. (James 3:15-18). Petty covetous 
  worldly longings are replaced by the love of the Father (1 John 2:15-17) and 
  perfect love casts our fear so that we dwell in quietness, peace and confidence 
  (1 John 4:18, Isaiah 26:3). Holy people do not easily fly into rages or engage 
  in back-biting and quarrelling rather they are centred people full of love, 
  joy and peace (Galatians 5:19-23). There is thus a grand and holy emotional 
  authenticity that accompanies maturity in Christ. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a rough guide our emotions can be broken down into three classes:</p>
<p><b><i>Holy emotions</i></b> &#150; those experienced by God such as compassion, 
  joy, and holy indignation and those that accompany life in the Spirit such as 
  praise, worship and adoration. These emotions are derived from the kingdom of 
  light and the Sprit (Ephesians 5:18-21, Colossians 3:16-17, Galatians 5:22,23) 
  and are in agreement with true wisdom (James 3:17,18) They are the emotions 
  of Christ in us. They are not necessarily religious or pious emotions. Admiring 
  a flower or delighting in beautiful music or focussing on the beautiful and 
  the good can be just as holy as going to church. (Philippians 4:8)</p>
<p><b><i>Human emotions</i></b> &#150; based in our human situation and the created 
  order and shared by Jesus during His time on earth. This includes emotions such 
  as grief, pain, fear, abandonment, sadness and sorrow, anxiety, stress, anguish 
  and vulnerability. These emotions are well chronicled in the Psalms. For the 
  Christian they are temporary and in eternity there shall be no more crying or 
  sadness or pain (Revelation 21:4). While these emotions may feel bad they are 
  not evil or toxic. They can be painful but they are not poisonous.</p>
<p><b><i>Fleshly emotions </i></b>&#150; are poisonous and destructive and include 
  toxic emotions such as malice, envy, selfish ambition, sensuality, bitterness, 
  overpowering lusts and murderous hatred. They are closely tied up with the works 
  of the flesh and with evil deeds. Their outcome is spiritual death. These emotions 
  were not part of mankind at Creation and are not &#147;natural human reactions&#148; 
  (For instance grief is a natural human reaction but bitterness is fleshly. One 
  can have &#147;good grief&#148; without a trace of bitterness. Bitterness is 
  not natural to the human condition.) Rather these emotions are derived from 
  the kingdom of darkness and have their source in a dark wisdom (James 3:14-16). 
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This classification helps us see the relative value of our emotional responses 
  and to use the techniques described in the succeeding chapters to assist with 
  our sanctification. It also puts the lie to the old humanist rubric &#147;there 
  are no right or wrong emotions.&#148; All emotions are not equal. Some are of 
  much higher value than others and some emotions and impulses are positively 
  wrong. This classification also goes a bit beyond the black and white classification 
  of emotions as &#145;spiritual&#148; or &#147;unspiritual&#148; that causes 
  so much pain in traditional missionary circles. When pain and disappointment 
  are seen as &#147;unspiritual&#148; we simply add to the burden the person is 
  carrying. Hurt, disappointment, pain and frustration are valid human emotions 
  stemming from our creatureliness encountering a fallen world. Human beings were 
  created good but mortal and it is as we explore this mortality that we find 
  out many useful things about ourselves. The above simple classification also 
  saves us from the error of stopping there with our human emotions and being 
  content simply to explore ourselves at that level. It tells us there is something 
  higher, something beyond our mortality and that it is as we focus on our immortality 
  in Christ that we develop the highest and noblest parts of our being. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are thus called to participate in the holy emotions so that they transcend 
  the human emotions and overcome the fleshly emotions. By this I mean that we 
  must choose our emotional level and which emotions we will be gripped by. When 
  disappointment strikes we can choose to respond with holy emotions and pray 
  through until we trust God and can praise Him as the Psalmist did or we can 
  respond at the human level and sit down disconsolate in human misery and gradually 
  see it through or we can respond from fleshly emotions and lash out in anger, 
  bitterness, distrust and revenge. Consider Paul in jail in Philippi in Acts 
  16. He praised God, sang psalms and rejoiced thus transcending the human emotions 
  of pain and discomfort and effectively banishing any fleshly emotions such as 
  bitterness or desire for revenge. Thus Paul participated in holy emotions so 
  that they transcended the human emotions and overcame the fleshly emotions. 
  The human emotions are not denied or seen as wrong rather they are acknowledged 
  but not focussed on. They are transcended. The saint focuses on and deliberately 
  chooses to move toward the holy emotions. Prayer, fasting, praise and worship, 
  reading Scripture, meditating on good teaching and doing good works are all 
  helpful in this process. However above and beyond these things we need the work 
  of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Holy Spirit responds differently to each of theses three categories of 
  emotion. The Holy Spirit rejoices and assists us when we engage in holy responses. 
  He produces them within us so they can justly be called &#147;the fruit of the 
  Spirit&#148;. (Romans chapters 8 &amp; 12, and Galatians 5) On the other hand 
  the Holy Spirit comforts us when the human emotions such as grief overwhelm 
  us (see 2 Corinthians 1). Finally He is determined to break the grip of fleshly 
  emotions such as hatred, lust and revenge. In fact the Spirit wars against such 
  impulses so that we cannot fully give way to our worst desires (Galatians 5:16-18). 
  Thus the Holy Spirit produces holy emotions, comforts overwhelming human emotions 
  and wars against fleshly emotions. However we have a choice in the matter. We 
  can take heed of the Spirit&#146;s promptings or we can discard them in fleshly 
  rebellion. This leads Paul to say that the mind set on the flesh and its fractious 
  emotions &#147;is death&#148; but the mind set on the Spirit with His holy emotions 
  is &#147;life and peace&#148;(Romans 8:5,6).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As we will see in other chapters, the Spirit renews the mind with its personal 
  perspective and belief structure. The renewed mind becomes centred on God and 
  can be validly called &#147;the mind of Christ&#148; (1 Corinthians 2:14-16). 
  Thus as the mind is redeemed and renewed and set on the Spirit life and peace 
  result. This life and peace that results from a well disciplined and renewed 
  mind is the aim of this book. This simple classification of emotions will be 
  vastly expanded as the complexities and subtleties of the emotional life of 
  the Christian life are explored. Our emotions need redemption if they are to 
  become holy and the focus of all redemption is Jesus Christ who will be our 
  model and pattern for biblical EQ.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>How Come Christians Seem To Stop Changing Emotionally After A Few Years?</b></p>
<p>Massive early transformation followed by accommodation to religious sub-cultural 
  norms is a fairly common pattern among Christians from emotionally damaging 
  childhoods. Church life provides many little nooks and crannies where we can 
  hide from the Holy Spirit and the hard work of emotional transformation. In 
  many cases painful emotions are not understood by the clergy and even by some 
  Christian counselors and damage is done. This book will seek to bring wisdom 
  and balance to the Christian handling of emotions. However all is not the fault 
  of the clergy, church culture or inadequate theological and counseling training. 
  Much is our own fault. Each of us has defense mechanisms against change such 
  as rationalization, projection, and denial. We dodge dealing with God and we 
  duck change.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yet I believe one of the greatest obstacles to emotional health in Christian 
  circles is that we simply don't understand our emotions or we lack proper mechanisms 
  for dealing with them. Many Christians are ignorant of Scriptural teaching on 
  emotional life and so are left stranded with a few basic techniques that barely 
  scratch the surface of the problem. In a puzzling , almost paradoxical way, 
  we also take our emotions too seriously and make them the source of our spiritual 
  self-esteem. When we feel holy and good and positive we judge ourselves as being 
  &quot;up&quot; spiritually and when we are feeling distant or depressed we judge 
  ourselves as being &quot;down&quot; spiritually. In fact the connection between 
  emotions and spirituality is fairly loose. Some very happy optimistic people 
  are carnal and worldly, while some serious gloomy types are deeply spiritual 
  - and the reverse applies as well. While it is certainly preferable to feel 
  good and to &quot;rejoice in the Lord always&quot; even the apostle Paul admits 
  to times of intense pressure and discouragement. We see this particularly in 
  his letters to the Corinthians. And, of course, Jesus was known as &quot; a 
  man of sorrows and acquainted with grief..&quot;. Even tempting emotions need 
  not be sinful. Jesus was &quot;tempted in all things as we are, yet without 
  sin&quot;. Yet there is indeed a deep connection between our emotions and our 
  character.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Are Emotions Important? Do They Build Christian Character And Ethics?</b><br>
  The common observation of philosophers and theologians as diverse as Aristotle 
  and C.S.Lewis has been that right affections and emotions form the basis for 
  right morality. If we love the good and abhor the evil we are far more likely 
  to be good. And if we hate bribes and value integrity we are far more likely 
  to be honest. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ethics is not a purely intellectual exercise. From antiquity it has involved 
  feeling, thinking and acting rightly. True agape love has emotions that are 
  ethical. &#147;Love does not rejoice in iniquity but rejoices in the truth&#148; 
  (1 Corinthians 13:6). Being horrified by certain sins is a good and moral thing. 
  Rejoicing in the truth is a right emotional response for the disciple. Our emotional 
  valuation of life should be in agreement with our ethical stance. In biblical 
  terms the person who is right emotionally loves good and hates evil. In their 
  emotions they value what God values. The emotionally perfected Christian is 
  not just &#147;together&#148; or integrated in the secular sense rather they 
  are righteous and just and holy and perfectly loving. Their emotions agree with 
  their ethics which agree with the Scriptures which agree with God. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>What we like and dislike gradually shapes the course of our life and character. 
  This is why TV and advertising can have such a profound effect. It teaches us 
  to like a certain lifestyle filled with material things and to value being sexy 
  and attractive. It teaches us, ever so gradually not to dislike fornication 
  and adultery. Rarely does it blatantly say &#147;adultery is good&#148; &#150; 
  it just teaches people to like the idea of being attractive to many people and 
  to be quietly thrilled by the notion of perhaps having many sexual partners. 
  Thus, over time their ethical resolve is weakened, the emotions that drive holiness 
  are eroded and thousands of Christians fall into sin they would not have contemplated 
  too many years ago. What we like and dislike, what we value and esteem, is critical 
  to what we will eventually become.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unfortunately we have divorced emotions from ethics. We see ethics as &#147;our 
  opinion&#148; about things not our reaction to things. At times we even train 
  ourselves to think one way and feel another. We ask people to be righteous and 
  biblical yet feel embarrassed at our fellow Christian who get genuinely get 
  angry over sin and moral decay. By doing this we say its Ok to just have notions 
  not emotions. That Christianity is best kept in the head not in the heart. Then 
  we wonder why they do not give and why they do not commit to discipleship! We 
  teach Christian young people to be sexy, sophisticated and emotionally unshockable 
  then expect them to value chastity. We are asking the impossible. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our emotions reflect what we value and cherish, admire and love and they also 
  reflect what we dislike loath and reject. Our emotions undergird our choices 
  and our choices form the foundations for our character and destiny. If our emotions 
  are askew our choices and destiny will surely follow suite. During my university 
  years I often tutored high school students in calculus. The biggest obstacle 
  was nearly always emotional rather than intellectual. It was moving the student 
  past emotional valuations such as &#147;I hate maths&#148; and &#147;homework 
  is horrible&#148;. Because they had been taught by parents and peers that mathematics 
  was odious and loathsome and homework was dull they were not doing their work. 
  Because they were not doing their work they were failing mathematics. If they 
  failed mathematics they would not get into university in Australia or into a 
  decent career. Their emotional attitude, learned from others, was affecting 
  their entire future.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The ability to delay gratification is fundamental to the development of good 
  character. An experiment was set up where small children were given a choice: 
  one marshmallow now, or two in ten minutes time. To get two marshmallows they 
  had to delay gratification - a basic skill in managing and discipling their 
  emotions. When the children were then followed up in a longitudinal study the 
  difference between the &#147;grabbers&#148; and the &#147;patient&#148; was 
  incredible. The most impatient and impulsive achieved less and got into trouble 
  more while the most patient were more successful in practically every sphere 
  of life. In fact this test proved more predictive of success at school and in 
  life than IQ tests or any other social variable. This simple act of emotional 
  management was a key to later success in life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thus right emotions are an important part of right character and right ethics 
  and right emotions undergird right choices and right destiny. To emotionally 
  rejoice in truth, to celebrate justice, to delight in noble actions and to embrace 
  compassion and mercy is to have emotions that complement our faith. On the other 
  hand confused emotions can destabilise us and create conflicts. Finally the 
  presence of strong lustful and evil emotions can drive us to sin and blind us 
  to truth. Thus sorting ourselves out emotionally is much more than just getting 
  our act together. It is getting our heart in line with our faith and with our 
  God. But which way is up? How can we know which emotions are right, which are 
  wrong and which are neutral? How can we get an idea of what an emotionally together 
  and righteous and holy Christian looks like? As in everything else Jesus is 
  our model and that is the subject of the next chapter</p>
