<p> </p>
<p>As I write this chapter the news is filled with the horror of the terrorist 
  attacks on the World Trade Centres. Emotions such as grief, sympathy, sorrow, 
  anger, anxiety and perplexity are openly being expressed. The world teeters 
  on the brink of war and there is anxiety about the stock market&#146;s ability 
  to open on Monday. The air seems charged with highly contagious emotion. Now 
  how can I recognise all this from a television screen? What gives us the capacity 
  to read another person&#146;s emotional state and to respond to it? What happens 
  when we fail to do so? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are about 30 or so common emotions that are reasonably easily recognised. 
  These include, fear, surprise, apprehension, sadness, elation, doubt, anxiety, 
  guilt, contentment, sexual interest, curiosity, anger, frustration, annoyance, 
  and laughter amongst others. A sensitive, discerning person may be able to recognise 
  hundreds of different types of emotions while an abusive person may recognise 
  as few as nine or ten. Criminals frequently have trouble recognising or identifying 
  with the emotions of their victims. Sociopaths are almost completely unable 
  to recognise emotions in others in any meaningful way.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Jesus and Emotional Recognition</b></p>
<p>Jesus was able to recognize emotions in Himself (&#147;my heart is deeply troubled&#148;) 
  and others (&#147;for He knew what was in the hearts of all men&#148;) and was 
  able to read situations with astonishing accuracy and spiritual perception. 
  This made His ministry very effective and His encounters with His opponents 
  very humbling for them. Jesus could read, understand and appropriately categorize 
  people e.g. as &#147;wolves&#148;, &#147;whitewashed tombs&#148; or as &#147;that 
  old fox&#148; and He was always spot on. We are not quite so fortunate and it 
  seems that we are always learning about how to read people and continually being 
  surprised by the twists and turns of the human personality.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jesus judgement of others was not by sense perception alone for Scripture says 
  He did not judge &#147;by the hearing of the ear or as the eye sees&#148; (Isaiah 
  11:3). Rather He judged by the Spirit of the Lord. His connection with God gave 
  Him the perception, beliefs, wisdom and understanding with which to make accurate 
  judgements about other people. He also would have used His five senses but the 
  data from them would have been fed into the existing faith framework. Faith 
  perception was primary and sense perception fitted into that, yet if you had 
  tested any of His findings, you would find they were not vague and mystical 
  but would have stood the test in the real world. They were not fanciful mystical 
  attributions but factual, correct and perceptive judgements.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jesus&#146; advice on the topic of discerning other people was generally simply 
  to look at their actions, not their words and especially to look at the fruit 
  of their lives. (Matthew 7:20) Later on we will see why that advice is so valuable. 
  For now we just need to note that Jesus did advocate using one&#146;s eyes ears 
  and intellect when reading other people. Jesus did not recommend a peculiar 
  mystical formula for arriving at conclusions about people but rather He recommended 
  careful and prayerful analysis based on facts taken over time. While this advice 
  was primarily aimed at helping the disciples assess human character it is also 
  good advice when assessing human emotions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Emotional Recognition</b></p>
<p>It seems sophisticated neural processing is needed for the recognition of emotions 
  and that it is based in an almond shaped part of the brain called the amygdala. 
  (Damasio et al. found that bilateral damage to the amygdala impaired the recognition 
  of emotion from facial expressions.) To give you an idea of how complex this 
  task is, &#147;affective computing&#148; or teaching computers to recognise 
  emotions in humans, struggles, even on fast computers, to obtain a 50% success 
  rate on just 8 basic emotions. The complexity of the task of accurate emotional 
  recognition means that it is a task we are learning all life long.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But isn&#146;t emotional recognition simply a &#147;natural attribute&#148; 
  with some people being naturally sensitive to others while others are brutish 
  and insensitive? There is plenty of evidence in the EQ literature that emotional 
  recognition is partly genetic wiring and starts very early in life. However 
  there are two schools of thought. One school says EQ is truly innate, that we 
  can be damaged but not improved. That EQ is set very early in life and is mainly 
  genetic and that like IQ it can be reduced (say by a blow to the head or emotional 
  abuse) but not improved. Thus this view maintains that a sensitive person can 
  be hurt and become emotionally clumsy but that a person born with a brutish 
  disposition cannot become sensitive. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The other view is that EQ, while having a genetic component is a teachable 
  skill. My experience from teaching EQ seminars is that about 85% of people are 
  teachable to varying degrees but 15% have not even the faintest desire to improve 
  emotionally. I think that on the whole EQ is more learned than genetic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Emotional Recognition and Christian Ministry</b></p>
<p>Sensitive and caring ministry to others depends on being able to accurately 
  recognise and understand the source of emotion in others. Without this skill 
  pastoral care will be clumsy at best and damaging at worst. Tasks such as counselling 
  and prayer ministry require a fine feeling for personal emotions. If God has 
  called us to ministry He has called us to minister grace to a hurting and damaged 
  world and called us to be able to understand people &#150; including being able 
  to read their emotions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is becoming increasingly difficult as in our multi-cultural societies 
  ministry means reading emotions of people from different backgrounds, genders, 
  and ethnicities than our own. Any pastor of a church of any size in the modern 
  world will have to be able to read the feelings of people of half a dozen races 
  and a wide variety of professional and economic backgrounds. We cannot run away 
  from this challenge but must embrace the learning required to be emotionally 
  competent ministers in a complex world. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Interestingly some research done with the Penn Emotional Recognition Test suggests 
  that introverts have better skills at recognising emotions than extraverts. 
  Given that extraverts are more socially active this seems surprising. Perhaps 
  introverts have greater sensitivity which makes them withdraw from numerous 
  interactions through overload. It also gives some truth to the stereotype of 
  the loud, insensitive extravert! Thus quiet sensitive counsellors and spiritual 
  directors may indeed be the ones to look for when you want your emotions deeply 
  understood.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In reading another person&#146;s heart the thoughts, intents and feelings need 
  to be surfaced. Jesus, our model, was deeply emotionally aware and &#147;knew 
  what was in the hearts of men&#148;. He did not just read the surface emotional 
  issues but the deeper undercurrents of the heart. There are some gender differences 
  in what people conceal and what they are willing to reveal though these are 
  far from absolute. In general I find men are willing to talk about their plans 
  and intentions and tend to conceal their feelings while tend to women conceal 
  their plans and intentions and are more revealing of their feelings. While it 
  is relatively easy to recognise the six basic emotions of happiness, sadness, 
  fear, anger, surprise and disgust it is very hard to recognise thoughts and 
  intentions and the more subtle emotions such as apprehension and tentativeness. 
  Reading people deeply takes time and practice and wisdom. Here are a few clues 
  I have found helpful:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1. Start from a neutral position as free as possible from your own baggage. 
  The more emotion you are carrying &#150; and thereby projecting onto others, 
  the more inaccurate you are. A study by Walz showed that aggressive men saw 
  more anger in other people than was really there. The aggressive men were projecting 
  their own anger onto others. This mislabelling led to behaviour problems in 
  life as they reacted in hostile ways to this perceived but non-existent aggression. 
</p>
<p>2. If you do have a great deal of pain, do not try counselling others until 
  you have dealt with it. This is why I recommend that Christian counsellors and 
  ministers who have been recently divorced take two years out from the ministry 
  until their emotions have been worked through. There is generally too much baggage 
  there to be accurate in reading emotions and to be therapeutic in counselling.</p>
<p>3. Do not take the latest bit of psychology you have read and dump its conclusions 
  and observations on everyone. I have a lot of time for the MBTI personality 
  test and similar instruments but personality typology can become an obstacle 
  to judgement when taken too literally. In general look at the objective facts 
  about the person first then, much later, employ your theories.</p>
<p>4. There is no prize for the hastiest judgment. Suspend religious judgements 
  until all the facts are in. Hasty labelling of clients and leaping to spiritual 
  conclusions is unwise and potentially damaging. There is plenty of time to come 
  to conclusions, so use it wisely and well. </p>
<p>5. Listen to understand and not to judge. There is indeed a place for confronting 
  sin &#150; after we have fully understood the situation. If we seek to understand 
  first and listen intently and with intelligence and wisdom our words of admonition 
  will be far fewer, much more on target, and more easily accepted by the parishioner.</p>
<p>6. Expand your own emotional vocabulary. For instance use words like exhilarated 
  instead of &#147;up&#148; and &#145;satisfied&#148; instead of &#147;good&#148;. 
  By becoming aware of a wide range of emotional terms as they apply to yourself 
  you will be soon able to pick up these finer emotional tones in others as well. 
  Roget&#146;s Thesaurus is a good starting point.</p>
<p>7. Use the &#147;mirror principle&#148; to work out what the other person is 
  thinking. By the mirror principle I mean the observation that what A thinks 
  of B is generally the mirror opposite of what B thinks of A. For instance if 
  you think someone is very tall then you probably look short to him or her. If 
  you think someone is not too intelligent you probably look like a complicated 
  intellectual to him or her. If you think that certain people are quiet and polite 
  they probably think you are loud and rude. And if you think young people are 
  loud and over the top and energetic they probably think you are staid, quiet 
  and a bit on the slow side. People are often seeing you in an exact mirror image 
  of how you see them.</p>
<p>8. If you can get hold of a &#147;chart of emotions&#146; do so. These charts 
  have dozens of different facial expressions with the emotions labelled underneath. 
  A counsellor should be able to help you get hold of one.</p>
<p>9. Don&#146;t just read one aspect e.g. facial expressions, voice, body language 
  or verbal statements. Survey the whole person and watch for patterns as a whole. 
  Just reading body language alone can lead you astray. For instance a person 
  with their arms crossed may be just cold from the air-conditioning &#150; not 
  rejecting what you are saying at all. You need to look at all the other factors 
  as well.</p>
<p>10. Try and figure out what they are not saying as well as what they are saying. 
  For instance if a client talks freely about everyone in their family with the 
  exception of their father &#150; about whom they are totally silent, then there 
  may be something worth exploring.</p>
<p>11. Study crowds and pick up on social distance, actions and reactions. The 
  location of the person in the room , who they are talking to, how many people 
  they move amongst and the degree of animation they are showing. For instance 
  a person who is feeling timid may be in the corner of the room, the person who 
  is feeling lonely may be on their own, the socially insecure may be glued to 
  just one person and the tragically disconnected person may be near the bar and 
  drinking a bit too much. </p>
<p>12. Assume that even the most seemingly irrational behaviour seems intelligent 
  to the person doing it. Then try and work out what that reason is. What thought 
  is behind it? What need are they trying to meet? What emotion is driving it?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>False Positives and False Negatives</b></p>
<p>Most of us have an area that we &#147;get wrong&#148; consistently when reading 
  others. A &#147;false positive&#148; is when you think someone is happy and 
  they are not. It is mistakenly thinking the situation is better than it is. 
  Most men think their marriages are good when their wives think otherwise. Thus 
  the men have a &#147;false positive&#148; when it comes to reading their wives 
  emotional state. A false negative is when a person thinks a situation is bad 
  when it is in fact good or OK. For instance a person from a rejecting family 
  may see anger or rejection around them in normal friendly social situations. 
  They have a &#147;false negative&#148; when it comes to reading others emotions. 
  They &#147;fill in the blanks&#148; with rejection and find it difficult to 
  believe they are accepted. These false attributions can have enormous social 
  consequences. The young man who thinks a girl loves him when she does not and 
  goes away heartbroken, the husband who thinks his wife is flirting with other 
  men when it is not the case and becomes enraged &#147;over nothing&#148;, or 
  the feeling in many offices that &#147;the boss does not care about us&#146; 
  when that is often far from the truth. Learning to read other people&#146;s 
  emotions accurately can thus save us much pain.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>False reading of other people&#146;s emotions leads to mistaken action and 
  reactions on our behalf. People react to &#147;shadows&#148; instead of realities 
  and defend themselves from perceived emotional threats that simply do not exist. 
  For instance if we believe that the boss hates us and is about to fire us we 
  may start a rumour campaign or even resign our job to avoid the rejection. What 
  a surprise if we get promoted instead! We do not just react to circumstances 
  we react to our interpretation of those circumstances particularly the emotional 
  perception &#150; whether we are liked or disliked, accepted or rejected, valued 
  or despised. Most people will stay at even a lower paying job if they perceive 
  they are liked, accepted and valued. Therefore people who habitually see the 
  world as disliking them, rejecting then and despising them are going to find 
  life tough going. They, like Cain, will be a wanderer on the earth. This is 
  indeed tragic if their fears are unjustified and their rejection only in their 
  own minds.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To continue this thought for a while we need to look at how &#147;false negatives&#148; 
  can affect us socially and politically. When people constantly misread others 
  intentions towards them and this spreads to an entire group then entire churches, 
  denominations, cities and even nations can become embroiled in it. This group 
  aspect of emotional misunderstanding is often indicated by phrases such as &#147;they 
  hate me&#148; or &#147;they are up to something&#148; where &#147;they&#148; 
  is rather loosely defined. Eventually false negatives can come to include whole 
  classes of people e.g. &#147;all men are lustful rapists&#148; or &#147;all 
  Americans hate Muslims&#148; which of course rapidly leads to prejudice. If 
  this goes far enough the false negative can involve an all-embracing projection 
  of fear and suspicion upon the total environment. This fear and defensiveness 
  produces a harsh defining of boundaries between those who are &#147;in&#148; 
  and those who are &#147;out&#148;, those who are with us and those who are against 
  us. Or even between those who are of God and those who are of Satan. Fear, paranoia, 
  prejudice and hatred can all flow from allowing false negative attributions 
  of others to grow and become believed. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>How do these false perceptions come about? They mainly come about through three 
  basic errors in observation and logic:</p>
<p> The first error is not gathering all the facts, or using a biased source of 
  facts. Take the prejudice &#147;All Muslims are terrorists&#148;. If we base 
  our sampling on action movies where all the Muslims are terrorists we may arrive 
  at this conclusion. However if we gather all the facts we will find that there 
  are over 1 billion Muslims and that there are maybe 10,000 terrorists. So if 
  we do our sums we see that only one in one hundred thousand Muslims are terrorists. 
  Thus the complete facts do not bear out the prejudice that all Muslims are terrorists. 
  If truth be told, the facts paint the opposite picture.</p>
<p>The second error is choosing to unjustifiably filter the facts so that some 
  aspects are emphasised and some heavily discounted. For instance take the radical 
  feminist rhetoric &#147;all men are rapists&#148;. This is easily disproved 
  statistically. However someone being shown the statistics on rape might say 
  &#147;Ok not all men have been caught as rapists and maybe not all men have 
  raped someone &#150; but they would if they could&#148; and thus the false negative 
  is maintained by using a &#147;filter&#148; which keeps the prejudice intact.</p>
<p>Or thirdly we can have no facts at all. The whole thing can be imaginary. We 
  can be so completely inaccurate in our reading of people that we get it completely 
  wrong to begin with. This is often due to our family background training us 
  to see things a certain way e.g. training us to see rejection where there is 
  none or being unduly suspicious of others motives.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Another source of error that I find is becoming common in Christian circles 
  is &#147;mystical attributions&#148; such as &#147;I sense in my spirit that 
  so and so has a Jezebel spirit&#148;. This often lacks an objective basis in 
  fact. Where I have seen it in operation it has been a power play that makes 
  the speaker look spiritual and perceptive and labels their enemy with a stigma 
  that is difficult to contest or remove. Unless there is substantial good evidence 
  for such a judgment these mystical observations that are plucked out of the 
  ether should be treated as insubstantial and perhaps even as dangerous. At best 
  they come from being misled about the nature of the gift of discernment. Genuine 
  discernment is both spiritual and intelligent with the Holy Spirit operating 
  through a renewed and quickened intellect not just through impressions. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>People who operate through inner impressions alone are liable to serious error. 
  Those who have a genuine gift of discernment are generally characterised by 
  a sharp mind, a habit of continual observation, a deep and quiet graciousness, 
  a listening spirit and the ability to keep their conclusions to themselves. 
  While the spiritual man does indeed judge all things he or she does not do so 
  irrationally and hastily or solely on the basis of an inner intuition. True 
  spiritual judgement is solid and substantiated. When Jesus said the Pharisees 
  were &#147;whitewashed tombs&#148; He was able to clearly point out why in factual 
  terms such as the devouring of widow&#146;s houses. He did not say &#147;In 
  my spirit I just know you are whitewashed tombs don&#146;t ask me why!&#148;. 
  The spiritual perception is a new framework that encompasses all known and substantiated 
  facts. Jesus said it is like reading the weather and knowing that a certain 
  wind means rain and another means heat. First there is observation and fact, 
  then there is interpretation of all the observed facts in the light of Scripture 
  and the guidance of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At this point take a minute and ask yourself the following questions about 
  the ay you form judgements:</p>
<p>Do others say that you are overly critical or defensive?</p>
<p>How often do you properly gather the data?</p>
<p>How often do you sit down and calculate things out and check the facts?</p>
<p>Do you thoroughly search the Scriptures using a concordance or computer bible 
  or do you just pluck verses from here and there?</p>
<p>Do you &#147;look on the negative side of things&#148;? </p>
<p>Do you filter out positives?</p>
<p>Do you over-emphasize negatives?</p>
<p>Do you anticipate rejection when there is none? </p>
<p>Are you often suspicious of people and then find out that your suspicions were 
  unjustified? </p>
<p>Do you draw sharp boundaries between groups of people, lumping them together 
  as &#147;in&#148; or &#147;out&#146;, good or bad, with you or against you? 
</p>
<p>Do you fix on the negative and ignore the positive? </p>
<p>Does one bad part make the whole thing wrong for you? </p>
<p>Do you go on inner intuitions and dark emotions separate from objective evidence? 
</p>
<p>Do you feel that you must play judge, jury and executioner?</p>
<p>Do you imagine terrible things about people and imagine them doing evil deeds? 
  (e.g. &#147;I am sure our neighbours are bank robbers.&#148;)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If this partly describes you then you need to be aware of these tendencies 
  and strive to counteract them. If you have a constant sense of rejection you 
  may need to tell yourself: &#147;I am probably just imagining this, I always 
  see more rejection than there is.&#148; If you are overly suspicious stop and 
  ask &#147;Is this the real picture, are my suspicions based on solid evidence, 
  not just wild fancies? If you are constantly defensive and see criticism in 
  every remark, then try and re-interpret those remarks &#147;Maybe they were 
  just making a constructive suggestion, maybe it wasn&#146;t a personal criticism 
  at all.&#148; </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This involves standing outside your own mental processes and evaluating them. 
  Its called &#147;meta-cognition&#148; or thinking about thinking. You think 
  about the way in which you think and as you do this you correct that which is 
  unhelpful, illogical, irrational or untrue. In the realm of emotions we do this 
  by realising that our thinking about our emotional environment and other people 
  may be wrong. We than think about our thinking and challenge our negative perceptions 
  with the simple question &#147;Is this really so?&#148; Is it really so that 
  my wife is having an affair? Is it really so that my neighbour is a bank robber? 
  It is really so that everyone is out to get me?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Good emotional recognition means picking up the emotions that truly are present 
  in the situation such as love and acceptance and not projecting into it emotions 
  that may not be truly present in the situation such as criticism and rejection.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>False positives are generally not as dangerous as false negatives but can be 
  just as difficult to recognise and deal with. The pastor may build a castle 
  from a compliment and may start to believe that everyone likes him and become 
  oblivious to his weaknesses. The na&iuml;ve and sheltered may honestly believe 
  that all people are beautiful and have good intentions &#150; and only find 
  out otherwise in one of life&#146;s hard lessons. The missionary may think that 
  the village accepts him because it is polite to him while underneath they are 
  seething with anger at his cultural blunders. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The indication of false positives is constant disappointment. The girl does 
  not love you. The wonderful business opportunity sends you broke. The church 
  does not renew your call. The village eventually tells you what it thinks. There 
  is a balance here, on one hand its good to be positive, optimistic, hopeful 
  and full of faith and its Ok to strive high and fall flat now and then. That&#146;s 
  part of the journey, an honest mistake. On the other hand it&#146;s lousy to 
  be constantly and continually disappointed, ripped off and hurt. Lets be blunt, 
  its stupid, its folly, its not listening to your warning bells. There is often 
  a fine line between faith and folly and pain is a warning of folly. Blows are 
  made for the backs of fools. If you are constantly disappointed in relationships 
  then perhaps you are just too optimistic about how much people love you. If 
  you are in a constant state of shock and your plans come down with a thud at 
  regular intervals perhaps a reality check is in order.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are two main sources of false positives which are a) being conned by 
  others and b) being conned by ourselves. Sometimes the two work together so 
  that people who want something from us play on our vanity and then we go home 
  and strut and preen and daydream about how wonderful we are. As we do this we 
  edge closer and closer to catastrophe and disappointment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lets get a tough but fair biblical perspective on this. All people are sinners, 
  and for the vast majority of people self is on the throne. What does this mean? 
  It means that most ordinary people are primarily acting in their own self-interest 
  and are not particularly concerned about your interests except as they may intersect 
  with their own interests. They aren&#146;t terrorists or bank robbers but they 
  are not saints either. They are just plain selfish with a few bursts of altruism 
  at Christmas time and during a crisis. After these seasons of good-will it&#146;s 
  back to looking after number one. Neither are most people interested in the 
  fine points of being terribly good, honest and ethical, as this conflicts with 
  their more selfish interests. Sure they are not as dishonest as a con artist, 
  but they are not at all interested in becoming like Mother Teresa. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This means that selfishness rules and that real love and appreciation is relatively 
  rare. The Bible does not paint the picture of a world filled with good, nice 
  people who we can trust and who really love us. Neither does it paint a picture 
  of a world full of terrorists. It paints the picture of a selfish world that 
  has disconnected itself from God. This should be our picture also. If we see 
  everyone as &#147;nice&#148; we probably have a wrong picture, or a very low 
  standard of what being nice is. If we walk into a new group of people and believe 
  we have been instantly accepted and that everyone loves us and is only thinking 
  about our welfare &#150; then perhaps you should double check. Maybe behind 
  their acceptance they have a selfish motive. They may want your money, your 
  membership or even your soul. Normal people are only that nice when it is in 
  their self-interest to be that nice. Always ask, &#147;Who benefits?&#148; </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It does not hurt to ask the question &#147;Is it really so?&#148; in positive 
  circumstances, especially if they are unusually positive, and very especially 
  if things seem &#147;too good to be true&#148;. I have no intention of plunging 
  you into doubt and cynicism, that&#146;s why I dealt with false negatives first. 
  But I do not want you to be ripped off by nice salesmen of shonky goods, used 
  cars, cheap real estate and fake watches; or in the spiritual realm by cults 
  and some televangelists. My experience is that perhaps a dozen people, tops, 
  really love us, and act in our interest and care about us. That&#146;s good 
  and it makes life worthwhile. The rest of the 6 billion people on the planet 
  are only being nice in order to get something. Now that&#146;s Ok if it&#146;s 
  a fair trade. But sometimes its not a fair trade and we are being conned or 
  used. In which case we get disappointed. You cannot trust the 6 billion like 
  you trust the twelve. You need to be careful and cautious and wise.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By nature I am a positive, faith-filled optimist who loves seeing people achieve 
  and being involved in big projects and grand schemes. Unfortunately I am nearly 
  always way too optimistic and trusting and I need help with the details. So 
  I value the input of people who can help me see reality. I have needed to adopt 
  the solution-focused thinking mentioned earlier in the book and to meticulously 
  look at the data and ask tough realistic questions if I am to make the impossible, 
  possible in the real world. There is a balance between say, believing in everyone/selecting 
  the best possible staff; or between seeing all things as possible / and choosing 
  projects that are wise, sane and profitable and which will not bankrupt Frontier 
  Servants.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The questions I find most helpful in digging out reality are:</p>
<p>&middot; Who profits?</p>
<p>&middot; What is their track record?</p>
<p>&middot; What is this leading to?</p>
<p>&middot; Why do they want me in particular? </p>
<p>&middot; If I look at their actions alone, separate from their words and stated 
  policies, what picture do I get?</p>
<p>&middot; What are the statistics on this? (business opportunity etc.) Are they 
  showing the stats to me? Are the stats they are showing me reliable and verifiable</p>
<p>&middot; How much extrapolation is going on here? Am I taking a little acceptance 
  to mean total acceptance or a little profit as an indicator of great riches 
  to come? Am I just daydreaming?</p>
<p>&middot; What percentage of people who do this are truly successful? Are the 
  trainers and speakers rich and everyone else poor? Does the business itself 
  generate money or does talking about it generate the money and the business 
  itself is a scam?</p>
<p>&middot; What are the obvious, logical interests of this person/group of people? 
</p>
<p>&middot; What about the big four areas of self-interest which are money, sex, 
  power and status; are they involved in this, if so, how? </p>
<p>&middot; What do they want from me? Can I deliver those expectations? Should 
  I deliver those expectations?</p>
<p>&middot; Will I get a fair deal at the end of the day?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The above questions may seem at first to have little to do with our emotions. 
  But they do have a lot to do with avoiding disappointment on one hand and not 
  becoming overly cynical on the other. They are questions that will bring you 
  to the truth of the matter and help you get in contact with reality, which is 
  ALWAYS good for us emotionally. These questions do not have to give negative 
  answers. You may indeed find out that you will profit, that it is a fair deal, 
  they do really like you and they are reliable, honest people with a good track 
  record. If so go good! Go for it! The above questions will help you sort out 
  the wheat from the chaff and the rogues from the rest. They will enable you 
  to lead a less ripped off life and guide you to worthwhile and profitable areas 
  to spend your time, money and life energy. In fact I regularly watch the investment 
  channel CNBC, which is a bit weird for a missionary who has no investments of 
  any sort. I do this because I want to find out how realistic and successful 
  people think. The interviews on leadership and the tough questions people ask 
  and the emphasis on facts and data are healthy for me as I am someone who needs 
  to come down to earth regularly and not get lost in my nice, comfortable but 
  thoroughly impractical theological speculations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Other than being conned by others we can be conned by ourselves. We can mistake 
  mere politeness for genuine love or being given a position on a committee for 
  genuine acceptance. We project our own faith and hopefulness into the situation. 
  We extrapolate and we build castles in the air. We build expectations of love 
  and warmth and hope and success that go way beyond the facts, and that this 
  world may not deliver on. Pride and vanity alter our ability to objectively 
  look at ourselves and our plans and others. Pride and vanity puff us up so that 
  it becomes painful to be honest with ourselves and hard to look reality in the 
  face. We need to come to a &#147;sober estimate&#148;, not a wildly projected 
  estimate, of ourselves and of reality. When we have a fair idea of who we are 
  we and who others are we can see past flattery and politeness simply accepting 
  them as normal social nonsense. We can then instead listen to the real heart 
  values and concerns of those around us. We can hear what they are really saying. 
  We can learn to cope with the truth; which well may be that &#147;we are mainly 
  selfish and only love you a little bit&#148;. If we are to perceive the emotions 
  of other people truly and understand and communicate with them well, and attain 
  to a high biblical EQ, then we must be humble and meek to hear what is really 
  there.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But what will this do to our self-esteem? If we cannot con ourselves how do 
  we stay happy? If we have to face the truth, such as &#147;we are mainly selfish 
  and only love you a little bit&#148; - is that worth believing? Why not stay 
  with the illusion? Living in touch with reality is far more emotionally functional 
  and will eventually cause your self-esteem to grow and you become more successful. 
  How? I&#146;ll give you a common example from Christian culture. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Christian workers ask people to pray for them and support them and they get 
  a lot of positive vibes. With even a little bit of extrapolation they may think 
  &#147;All these people love me and hundreds of people will pray for me and support 
  me, they really care for me&#148;. Buoyed up by all this they become euphoric 
  and surge into ministry on cloud nine. They perceive the emotions of others 
  as being altruistic, positive, caring and full of love. Everyone is nice and 
  they are happy. But six months later there is a huge crash. People forgot to 
  pray, and people didn&#146;t support, and people were just being nice. It wasn&#146;t 
  real. Your brochures went in the bin. So bitterness overtakes the Christian 
  worker. Anger and resentment rise to the surface. All those broken promises 
  hurt and they hurt badly. If the Christian worker is lucky they wake up and 
  say: &#147;That&#146;s life, I should not have expected a fallen world to be 
  that nice. I&#146;ll divide my supporters into three groups. Those I know well 
  and who I know want all the details about what I am doing, then those who I 
  think will support regularly but are not terribly interested in the details 
  of the ministry, then the flaky ones who will support me once or twice then 
  give up. I&#146;ll divide my effort proportionately and expect my prayer support 
  and human understanding from the first group, my economic support from the second 
  group and a bit extra now and then from the third group but I will not rely 
  on them&#148;. Thus the Christian worker adjusts to reality, takes a sober and 
  realistic view of people, and works out how to move forward in a solution-focussed 
  way. They succeed. Life stabilizes, and ministry happens, and self-esteem grows. 
  Reality is good for you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>What&#146;s Going On Here?</b></p>
<p>One of the big barriers to correctly reading the emotions of another person 
  is that we cannot understand how on earth they could possibly react that way. 
  We make light of reality of the other person&#146;s emotions. People may react 
  in immature ways but we still need to try and understand the source of their 
  immaturity. Writing someone off as &#147;just unspiritual&#148; without understanding 
  why they are unspiritual does not contribute to the solution. It only contributes 
  to the problem. Lets take the teenage &#147;you don&#146;t love me&#148; explosion 
  as a classic case. The teenager stomps to their room, slams the door and accuses 
  their parents of not loving them. Why? Is it a means of gaining emotional distance 
  so they can feel free to grow up? Are they hurting and disappointed over a personal 
  matter and were not listened to at home? Writing off the reaction as unspiritual 
  or trying to cast out the demon of rebellion out will only make things worse 
  and rob the parents of insight and understanding and valuable relationship building 
  opportunities. Humouring the reaction then searching for understanding is far 
  more profitable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&middot; Firstly acknowledge the emotion as real. It may seem bizarre but it 
  is never the less being expressed. </p>
<p>&middot; Next, search for the concept that the person is acting on or reacting 
  to. With the teenager the concept they are reacting to may be &#147;you don&#146;t 
  listen and you don&#146;t understand&#148;. </p>
<p>&middot; Try to put that concept in a single phrase or sentence. Once you have 
  boiled down what they are reacting to in one sentence you have probably got 
  the gist of the matter. </p>
<p>&middot; Then ask &#147;why have they come to that conclusion, is it a mistaken 
  conclusion or a correct conclusion, and what can I do to help the matter?&#148;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With those four simple steps you can go a long way to sorting through emotions. 
  In addition bear in mind the three levels of a difficult conversation I mentioned 
  earlier in this book &#150; Facts, Feelings and Identity: </p>
<p>What are the facts of the situation? </p>
<p>How are they interpreting those facts and generating certain feelings? </p>
<p>What are they sensing about their identity &#150; is their core being under 
  threat in some way? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>To sum up this chapter &#150; as Christians we need to be sensitive to the 
  emotions of others so we can minister grace to a fragile and hurting world. 
  This means we need to be able to accurately read other people&#146;s emotions. 
  If our judgements are inaccurate it is often because of false positives or false 
  negatives. We need to review our thinking patterns so they are both faith-filled 
  and positive but also realistic and humble. Much can be gained by distilling 
  the thought behind a person&#146;s emotion into a single sentence. This sentence 
  provides the key thought that they are acting on or reacting to. It can also 
  help to ask about the facts, feelings and identity issues involved.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once we have identified another person&#146;s emotions we need to know how 
  to respond appropriately. That is the next chapter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Discussion Questions</b><br>
  <br>
  1. How important is it for people in ministry to be accurately able to read 
  the emotions of other people? <br>
</p>
<p>2. What are some of the main ways in which we make errors in judging other 
  people&#146;s emotions? <br>
</p>
<p>3. Jesus &#147;knew what was in the hearts of men&#148;; what do you think 
  this must have been like for Him? <br>
</p>
<p>4. What is a &#147;false negative&#146;? How does it come about? How can we 
  overcome our tendencies to think people do not like us? <br>
</p>
<p>5. What is a false positive? What are some of the dangers from false positives? 
  How can being realistic in our expectations improve our Christian life? <br>
</p>
<p>6. Jesus and the prophets often distilled a person&#146;s attitude into a single 
  sentence beginning with a phrase something like &#147;In your hearts you think&#133;&#148;. 
  Pick four well-known people such as movie stars and try to put in one sentence 
  what they might be thinking in their hearts. <br>
