<p> </p>
<p>This is a Christian handbook on emotional transformation. Biblical EQ is about 
  emotional competence, about being able to handle and discern emotions and express 
  them wisely. The emphasis of the book is ongoing growth rather than healing. 
  The book does not assume that the reader has emotional &#147;problems&#148; 
  that need to be &#147;fixed&#148;. This is not a book for people with high levels 
  of emotional pain to read to get better &#150; though it may achieve that. Biblical 
  EQ is a fitness manual rather than a diagnostic manual. Its focus is strength, 
  health and maturity. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The aim of this book is to equip Christians, especially those in the ministry, 
  by putting them in touch with the ground of their emotional being, getting them 
  to commit to become emotionally mature and Christ-like, and helping with the 
  correction of areas of imbalance and immaturity, then finally showing them how 
  to express emotions with clarity, integrity and sensitivity in the context they 
  are in. That&#146;s a lot for one book and so Biblical EQ starts with some pretty 
  solid foundations and build upwards because we are not tackling one emotion 
  at a time here but actually trying to rebuild the Christian&#146;s entire understanding 
  of the emotional life of the believer from the ground up. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The first section, on Jesus as our model, deals with some of the basic overall 
  biblical theology of emotions and is foundational to the rest of the book. It 
  is written from an evangelical viewpoint and at a level that should suit most 
  committed Christians. Its central premise is that Jesus Christ is the model 
  for our emotional life and that the sanctification of our emotions is a work 
  of grace involving the power of the Holy Spirit working in the committed Christian. 
  Its pictures the ideal Christian as having grand and powerful emotions that 
  are holy and good and which are wisely and appropriately expressed in God&#146;s 
  timing for His glory.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The second section, on the inner self and our emotional world, is perhaps the 
  part of the book that has the most new teaching for many readers. It spends 
  a lot of time looking at how emotions arise in our spirit, in our soul and from 
  our body and how these complex interactions create our emotions and our character. 
  It draws together many counseling techniques and Scriptural insights. It should 
  lead the reader to a deep understanding of self and of how others arrive at 
  the place they are emotionally. It is founded on a very literal and exhaustive 
  treatment of the Scriptures and tries to work from the biblical data and carefully 
  build an adequate understanding of the human person. Its central premise is 
  that our inner self is not constant and fixed but is &#147;being renewed day 
  by day&#148; and that we can be co-workers with God in this process of inner 
  renewal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The practical section is grounded in Proverbs-like general wisdom and common 
  sense and much will be familiar territory to some readers, however it is useful 
  to &#147;be stirred up by way of reminder&#148;. It deals with our experience 
  of self-mastery, emotions and issues of emotional regulation, how we can read 
  other people&#146;s emotions and how to express those emotions appropriately 
  in love. It also deals with how to tap into God&#146;s love so we can minister 
  to others. Its central premise is that God links to us through faith, which 
  works through love, which employs specific focused wisdom and knowledge, to 
  do good deeds and that on our side of the equation we facilitate this process 
  by fixing our minds firmly on Christ and mastering our personal responses. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This book tries to give you both the relationship aspects and the specific 
  focused wisdom and knowledge aspects of biblical EQ. References for further 
  reading, a teachers guide and an exhaustive index has been provided for those 
  who want to dip into the book to research a particular issue. A seminar manual 
  is also available as a separate publication.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Good emotional management is a highly needed commodity in Christian work. Without 
  it we can unintentionally make a complete mess out of our service for God. One 
  emotional explosion at the wrong moment can be held against us for a long time 
  to come and we are often judged by others on how we handle our emotions. Many 
  very productive Christian workers have had to leave the ministry because they 
  just could not manage their emotions well and this marred all their relationships. 
  So we need to do something &#150; but what can we do? The good secular materials 
  available do not draw on the resources that the Holy Spirit can bring to emotional 
  transformation and few good Christian resources exist that combine biblical 
  insights with good clinical data. This book is an attempt to do that. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In order to do this I have had to start with first principles and work out 
  a sort of biblical paradigm with Jesus at its center and the emotional life 
  of Jesus as our model. The Holy Spirit is seen as the main power behind emotional 
  transformation. Also tips and techniques from secular authors as well as their 
  data has been incorporated where this material is &#147;Christian-compatible&#148; 
  so to speak. So this book is divided into three sections, the biblical basics, 
  discussion of the inner self and our emotions, and practical tips on self-mastery 
  and emotional expression. Each of these sections has five or six chapters each. 
  The biblical section discusses some foundational teaching about the Christian 
  emotional life, the &#147;inner self&#148; section looks at how emotions arise 
  in our spirit and soul and are influenced by our body and how our inner emotional 
  life is formed, finally the practical section looks at our experience and understanding 
  of emotions and how they should be best expressed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>What is EQ?</b></p>
<p>Emotional intelligence is the term we use to describe a complex set of human 
  abilities related to emotional management. The four key aspects of emotional 
  intelligence as described by Mayer and Salovey (the pioneer researchers in the 
  area) are:</p>
<p>1. Emotional identification, perception and expression</p>
<p>2. Emotional facilitation of thought </p>
<p>3. Emotional understanding </p>
<p>4. Emotional management </p>
<p>Various other researchers, most notably Daniel Goleman, have broken these into 
  various sub-factors which are continually being reviewed. Recent findings in 
  neurology have contributed greatly to our understanding of where emotions arise 
  in the brain. The field is fluid and a final decision on what finally constitutes 
  EQ has not been entirely reached yet and there are two or three main schools. 
  However much is coming out of these studies that is very interesting from a 
  Christian perspective, as we shall see as we go along.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>What Is Biblical EQ?</b></p>
<p>This is the biblical perspective on the above four key skill areas. It doesn't 
  neglect the findings of neuroscience but it adds in the transforming power of 
  the Holy Spirit and the wisdom of Proverbs. It has as its model the emotional 
  life of Jesus Christ with His personal presence, self-control, emotional expressiveness 
  and discernment of situations. Thus it has a clear pattern, a master plan that 
  can be used to analyse theories and to determine what is true and false, wise 
  and unwise. Secular theories have no &quot;ideal person&quot; to point to - 
  they merely assemble ideals from their own theories and worldview. In Jesus 
  we have a model , a guide, a point to aim our teaching towards and this is invaluable. 
</p>
<p>The Christian believer is to aspire to have the emotional life of Christ Jesus 
  for that is very much part of being &quot;in His image&quot;. Above all Biblical 
  EQ is biblical - founded on faith in the inspired, inerrant and authoritative 
  Scriptures.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>The Failure Of The Secular Models of EQ</b></p>
<p>After reading various EQ books you know that emotions are important, that you 
  should handle them better and a lot about how they arose within you, but you 
  are not shown how to conquer them. In fact many of the EQ programs based on 
  this kind of research have had fairly middling results. The corporate sector 
  is pulling back from them, partly because of recession but partly because they 
  are not delivering as expected. Why is this so? Why has the secular approach 
  to emotional intelligence fizzled?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Firstly they have a philosophical underpinning that has no definite direction. 
  There is nothing intrinsic to the theory that tells them what to aim for when 
  helping a person achieve a higher level of emotional intelligence. Apart from 
  being in touch with ones emotions and being able to express them accurately, 
  appropriately and responsibly there is no &#147;big picture&#148; of what the 
  emotionally intelligent person should turn out like. People end up confused 
  and perplexed. Theories seem at variance with each other and the result is that 
  some practitioners are almost Zen Buddhists while others are extremely businesslike, 
  manipulative and pragmatic. Without any agreement on what an ideal person is 
  they cannot make much real progress. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Secondly much of the work of Goleman and others involves a model steeped in 
  a medical and neurological framework that sees our responses as entirely conditioned 
  by biology, genetics and environment. Alteration of responses is through medication, 
  education and behavior modification. After a while people start to feel depersonalized 
  by this approach, and react against the diminution of human responsibility that 
  seems to be the outcome. It is so reductionistic and materialistic that after 
  some initial enthusiasm people are repelled.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thirdly prayer and spiritual disciplines are marginalized in the literature 
  despite their utility. For instance on page 75 of Goleman's first book Emotional 
  Intelligence he says &quot;Finally, at least some people are able to find relief 
  from their melancholy in turning to a transcendent power. Tice (a researcher 
  into depression) told me &quot;Praying, if you are very religious, works for 
  all moods, especially depression&quot;. Despite this obvious therapeutic value 
  for prayer it is never again referred to in Goleman's book. People know religion 
  works - they are just refusing to admit it much in print. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Should we then throw out their work entirely? Not at all. Truth is truth and 
  measurements are measurements. There is an enormous amount of good work and 
  wise information in the current EQ literature. It can be, and is, very helpful 
  in giving us understanding of how our emotions work. However it does not give 
  us a whole lot of power to transform them. The power to defeat deep and difficult 
  emotions comes from God and involves the human spirit coming into contact with 
  God's Spirit. So in this book we shall tend to turn to secular sources to explain 
  much of the physiology and the mechanisms of emotion and to Christian sources 
  for the power to deal with them. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Core Concepts</b><br>
  To get answers that genuinely help people we need two things, a clear destination, 
  and the power to get there in a reasonable amount of time. Our destination is 
  the image of Christ Jesus, our power to get there is the infilling with and 
  transforming work of the Holy Spirit. These are just the some of the great advantages 
  of the gospel, we have hope, and we have lots of hope! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thus the central premise of the book is that Christians can have their emotional 
  life redeemed so that it is transformed to mirror the emotional life of Jesus 
  Christ and that the Holy Spirit&#146;s power and grace is the key to this process. 
  This involves renewing seven key aspects which will be discussed in detail as 
  we move along:</p>
<p>1. Renewing our basic perceptions of reality and our perspective on life.</p>
<p>2. Renewing our individual belief system.</p>
<p>3. Renewing the purposes and intents of our heart.</p>
<p>4. Renewing our physical bodies and their influence on our emotions.</p>
<p>5. Renewing our ability to be aware of and to understand our own emotions.</p>
<p>6. Renewing our ability to understand the emotions of other people.</p>
<p>7. Renewing our ability to appropriately express emotion according to the desire 
  of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The first few of these are a very deep work. It takes effort, courage and time 
  to change one&#146;s perspective on life or to review and change core beliefs, 
  thoughts and intentions. However unless this is done the foundations are not 
  strong and any positive emotional changes will be temporary at best. Thus it 
  is important that you work through the foundational chapters and understand 
  them. They are the chapters which will give you the deepest wisdom to assist 
  you with your emotional growth. Before we go much further we need to answer 
  a few of the common questions about emotions and that is the topic of the next 
  chapter . </p>
