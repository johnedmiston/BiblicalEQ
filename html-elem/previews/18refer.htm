<p> </p>
<p>The following suggestions are not meant to be prescriptive for the professional 
  educator but are merely a few suggestions which are meant as a help to those 
  of us who are not professional educators but have teaching responsibilities. 
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Biblical EQ can be used as a text book on emotional development and I suggest 
  the book be taught in 24 one hour lectures as follows &#150; one hour introduction, 
  six hours on the first six chapters in the theological section, ten hours on 
  the five chapters in the ontological section and finally eight hours of lectures 
  on the six chapters in the practical section (2 hrs each on the chapters on 
  first and last chapters in the section.) However the book is taught I think 
  20 hours of lectures would be a minimum for most undergraduate students to grasp 
  and digest the topic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For in-service courses and extension learning I would recommend pre-reading 
  the book and discussing it chapter by chapter by teleconference or in email 
  discussion groups. The book can be also easily be broken down into three one-day 
  workshops, one for each section, and taught as an intensive over a long weekend. 
  I also am preparing a one day seminar for church groups which just gives a very 
  basic coverage of the topics in the book.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Small group discussion in groups of three or four is absolutely essential for 
  this sort of material. The aim of this book will be largely defeated if you 
  teach it in a large classroom and use assignments and exams alone as the assessment 
  tool. A bright student could go through such a course largely unchanged. Students 
  should interact face to face about the issues and to stretch each other, as 
  gently as possible, so that real change and real growth occurs. Considerable 
  guidance and facilitation by the lecturer may be needed to ensure these discussion 
  groups achieve their aims. The section on private and public emotion should 
  perhaps be briefly reviewed in class at the commencement of the small groups 
  as some vulnerable students may share too much emotionally while others share 
  very little.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I would encourage students to keep a personal journal of their reflections 
  on the course (if this is considered an acceptable form of assessment) and encourage 
  discussion of case studies that they meet in their ministry experience. The 
  book raises many deep and provocative questions such as the mind-brain problem 
  and the nature of the human spirit. If a class is prone to wandering off into 
  less than edifying arguments over these issues they might be channeled into 
  15-minute formal class debates with a definite conclusion. These debates could 
  be made part of the &#145;participation&#148; mark that most lecturers give.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While the book has an objective to achieve emotional transformation it also 
  has an informational purpose and is content rich. Assessing understanding of 
  the content and the grasp of the concepts involved is very important so I would 
  encourage some academic form of assessment, such as a two hour exam at the end 
  of the course worth around half the marks. If assignments are to be used instead 
  of an exam I would suggest three separate assignments &#150; one on each section 
  as I think it would be very difficult to cover the course content with a single 
  term paper. Even in the case of in-services and courses where formal assessment 
  is not used the academic content still needs a little emphasis because it is 
  the concepts that will stay with the learner, perhaps popping into relevance 
  many years in the future. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>May the Lord lead you as you teach both the academic and experiential aspects 
  of Biblical EQ.</p>

  Note: Where references are missing some publishing details, these are books 
  I have lent and lost but which I have found very useful and which I recommend. 
  Most of the above works are secular and some are even a bit anti-Christian but 
  if you read them with discernment and in the framework Biblical EQ places them 
  in I am sure you will find them very profitable and useful.<br>
