<p> </p>
<p>It is one of the key teachings of Christianity that our Master and Model is 
  Jesus Christ and we are to be conformed into His image and be like Him in all 
  respects. Lets look at two well-known verses in this regard:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(Romans 8:29 NASB) For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed 
  to the image of His Son, that He might be the first-born among many brethren;</p>
<p> </p>
<p> (Ephesians 4:15 NASB) but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in 
  all aspects into Him, who is the head, even Christ,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>God's plan for our lives is that we become conformed to the image of His Son. 
  Now to &quot;grow up in all aspects into Him&quot; includes the emotional aspects 
  of the nature of Jesus Christ. Becoming emotionally mature and skilled is part 
  of our sanctification - but it is only a part. There are many other aspects 
  of sanctification as well such as faith, knowledge and purity. Growing up emotionally 
  is important and it&#146;s the part of sanctification that this book will focus 
  on but please don't get the impression that I think Biblical EQ is all there 
  is to sanctification.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Is Jesus Christ An Appropriate Model For Emotional Maturity?</b></p>
<p>There are a number of objections that people might think of against using Jesus 
  Christ as our Model of EQ:</p>
<p>1. The standard's too high, the idea is terrifying, it just gives me a panic 
  attack to think of it. I can never be like that. </p>
<p>2. He was God and sinless, I'm neither. He had an unfair advantage. What's 
  possible for him is just not possible for me.</p>
<p>3. There isn't enough information in Scripture to make a judgment. Its an argument 
  from silence. You can just make Jesus into whatever you want Him to be to suit 
  your purposes.</p>
<p>4. He was Jewish and lived in the Third World 2000 years ago and just ambled 
  around the place healing lepers. What would He know about the pressures of corporate 
  life and the emotional jungle that my office is? OR I'm a woman, He was a man 
  and totally different emotionally. Its just silly to ask me to be like Jesus.</p>
<p>5. Jesus was a prophet and had the emotions of a prophet. I could never be 
  that confrontational - its not my spiritual gift.</p>
<p>6. Jesus? High EQ? Kind of lacking in social skills if you ask me! I'm much 
  more tactful and artful that that. Don't ask me to act in ways that get you 
  nailed to a lump of wood.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Well lets look at some ways we can answer those objections and the assumptions 
  that underlie them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Objection 1: The Standard Is Too High</b></p>
<p>Solution: Jumping Off Jacob's Ladder - Getting Rid Of Legalism Over Emotions 
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Many evangelicals have a &quot;Jacob's Ladder&quot; view of the spiritual life 
  with Jesus at the top and host of angels in-between and Christians climbing 
  up rung by painful rung. The idea is to ascend to perfection, to strive to arrive. 
  One slip and you tumble to the bottom to start all over again. Those that adhere 
  to this view of spirituality are always envying those ahead of them, clinging 
  on to the ladder for dear life, and having not too much to do with those &#147;below&#148; 
  lest they get dragged down. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This view of the Christian life is thoroughly unbiblical. Ephesians 2:6 tells 
  us that all those who are in Christ are already seated with Him in heavenly 
  realms and Hebrews 12 tells us that we have come (past tense) to the Heavenly 
  Zion. In Christ we have already arrived in terms of spiritual status. There 
  is no ladder and if there is all born-again Christians are standing shoulder 
  to shoulder on the top rung as brothers of Jesus Christ (Hebrews 2:10-15). We 
  have been saved by grace and not by our own spiritual strivings (Eph 2:8-10) 
  and there is no condemnation for those in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:1) including 
  condemnation about our emotional life. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Aspiring to be like Jesus is not a matter of status or spiritual ascent. It&#146;s 
  a journey, a destination, a joyous arriving. It was what we were made to be 
  like from all eternity. If we view our emotional life as an indicator of spiritual 
  status then it will be utterly terrifying to think of Jesus as our model. Every 
  emotional insecurity will seem a &quot;sin&quot; and every lustful thought a 
  pathway to Hell. If we judge ourselves and rate our spiritual life by the difference 
  between our emotional life and the emotional life of Christ, by how far we have 
  yet to go on our imaginary Jacob's ladder, then all we will feel is endless 
  guilt and insecurity. By trying to go up, you will go under.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you recognize yourself as being on an imaginary Jacob's Ladder - then its 
  time to &quot;jump off&quot;. To let go of striving and relentless self-assessment. 
  To stop comparing yourself to those around you. To let the strain of sanctification 
  go and to instead to learn how to receive grace so that you grow far more quickly 
  than you can in your own strength. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When I am saying &quot;lets consider Jesus as our model for the emotional life 
  of the Christian&quot; I am NOT setting a new standard to be &quot;lived up 
  to&quot; by discipline and self-control. Your discipline and self-control will 
  run out long before you reach that standard! Being like Jesus is our vision 
  and our destination. We fix our eyes on Jesus, we seek to grow up into Him, 
  we pattern ourselves after Him. It becomes an exploration and an adventure, 
  a time of growing and learning, a receiving of grace upon grace as we learn 
  to be like Him. It is a gracious growing - not a terrifying ascent.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Objection 2 - He was God and that's cheating!</b></p>
<p>Solution: He was also fully human. Jesus was the prototype of the perfect Christian, 
  the elder brother among many brethren. We are of the same kind as Him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jesus was not some aloof divine maharaja floating six inches above the ground, 
  another category of being entirely from you and I. Jesus is God yet He was also 
  fully human and tempted in every point as we are and still retains that humanity 
  in Heaven as our faithful high priest.</p>
<p>(Hebrews 2:10-18 NASB) For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things, 
  and through whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect 
  the author of their salvation through sufferings. {11} For both He who sanctifies 
  and those who are sanctified are all from one Father; for which reason He is 
  not ashamed to call them brethren, {12} saying, &quot;I WILL PROCLAIM THY NAME 
  TO MY BRETHREN, IN THE MIDST OF THE CONGREGATION I WILL SING THY PRAISE.&quot; 
  {13} And again, &quot;I WILL PUT MY TRUST IN HIM.&quot; And again, &quot;BEHOLD, 
  I AND THE CHILDREN WHOM GOD HAS GIVEN ME.&quot; {14} Since then the children 
  share in flesh and blood, He Himself likewise also partook of the same, that 
  through death He might render powerless him who had the power of death, that 
  is, the devil; {15} and might deliver those who through fear of death were subject 
  to slavery all their lives. {16} For assuredly He does not give help to angels, 
  but He gives help to the descendant of Abraham. {17} Therefore, He had to be 
  made like His brethren in all things, that He might become a merciful and faithful 
  high priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of 
  the people. {18} For since He Himself was tempted in that which He has suffered, 
  He is able to come to the aid of those who are tempted.</p>
<p>This passage and others like it in Hebrews (4:14-16, 5:7-10) emphasize that 
  life or Jesus was difficult. It was so difficult that it was quite rightly described 
  as suffering and had all the emotional hallmarks of suffering. It was no light 
  suffering for it was to have the effect of perfecting Him! It was a suffering 
  that matured His obedience by testing it under very stressful conditions. As 
  we shall see Jesus was pressed again and again to almost breaking point but 
  He never sinned. Though He was God He laid aside those privileges (Philippians 
  2:5-11) to become fully human and a servant and was &quot;made like His brethren 
  in all things that He might become a merciful and faithful High Priest&quot;. 
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He was made like us in our experiences of hunger, thirst, tiredness, frustration, 
  misunderstanding, betrayal and even of unjust treatment by others. Even a cursory 
  reading of the gospels will tell you that He did not just cruise through these 
  experiences. He wept, He rebuked, He cried out, He rejoiced, He got angry, He 
  became &quot;troubled in spirit&quot;, He groaned in anguish and sweated drops 
  of blood. Life for Jesus was difficult and it was often emotionally intense. 
  This has made Him merciful in His role as high priest for He has fully been 
  where we are.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In fact the reason we can be like Jesus is because became very much like us. 
  In fact He calls us &quot;brethren&quot; (Hebrews 2:11 ) which means that we 
  are enough alike Him to be considered family and to bear a close &#147;genetic 
  relationship&#148; that has some sort of equality about it. The Scriptures also 
  say that we share the heavenly realms with Christ Jesus, and are members of 
  Heavenly Zion (Ephesians 2:6, Hebrews 12:22-24). Therefore we are literally 
  &#147;in the same realm&#148; as Christ Jesus. Romans 8:29 tells us that we 
  will be conformed to His image almost like someone pressed into a mould. Our 
  shape will be the same as His shape. We will be like Him. There will be a resemblance. 
  We can resemble Him because he chose to resemble us. Finally Ephesians 4:15, 
  which I quote often in this book ,says we are to be made like Him &#147;in all 
  respects&#148;. That&#146;s a very close likeness. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>To dramatize this with a touch of humour- imagine I was to compare a trout 
  with a horse using these same criteria. Can a trout occupy the same realms a 
  horse? No, a trout swims in the river and a horse gallops on land.. Can a trout 
  be called a brother of a horse in any genetic likeness? Not at all.! Can a trout 
  be made into the image of a horse or expect to be made like a horse in all things? 
  Its ridiculous. In order to occupy the same realms, be brothers and be able 
  to transformed into Christ Jesus we must be very much LIKE Jesus. In fact we 
  are like Jesus because we are fully human and He became fully human. He became 
  like us so that we could become like Him. Jesus took on our emotional life so 
  that it may be redeemed and become like His emotional life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Finally we share a common destiny with Jesus Christ and a common home.</p>
<p> (John 14:1-4 NKJV) &quot;Let not your heart be troubled; you believe in God, 
  believe also in Me. {2} &quot;In My Father's house are many mansions; if it 
  were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. {3} &quot;And 
  if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself; 
  that where I am, there you may be also. {4} &quot;And where I go you know, and 
  the way you know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That where I am you may be also&quot;. This is not just the offer of 
  streets of gold. It&#146;s the offer of an elder brother to His younger brethren. 
  Its fellowship, its love and its family. We shall be enough like Jesus to be 
  considered family. He as the Son of God and we as sons of God. When we are made 
  in all aspects like Him and conformed to His image we will share His habitations 
  and have meaningful fellowship with our Lord and God. Going back to our trout 
  and our horse - there is no possibility of meaningful fellowship there. It is 
  only in likeness and communication that there can be fellowship with God. Jesus 
  is not alien to us but in fellowship with us and we can be like Him. Our emotions, 
  in the end, will be fitted for life in eternity with God. The goal of biblical 
  EQ is thus not commercial success or social popularity but fellowship with God 
  and harmony in Heaven.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Objection 3: There isn't enough information about His emotional life to 
  base an EQ theory on.</b></p>
<p>Solution: There is enough to give us key reference points so we can gain a 
  reasonable impression of what it means to have a redeemed and Christ-like emotional 
  life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The information about the emotional life of Jesus is contained both in direct 
  references to His humanity such as &quot;Jesus wept&quot; in John 11 and in 
  broader more theological references that imply His full humanity and complete 
  goodness. For instance John calls Him &#147;the light of life&#148; and states 
  that darkness had no place in Him and could not overpower Him. To have no &quot;darkness&quot; 
  in one's spirit is to have emotions that are never deceitful, false, envious, 
  spiteful, grumbling or small-minded. All his emotions were &quot;light&quot; 
  not in the sense of light-hearted but as in the sense of positive, true and 
  illuminating, righteous, appropriate and genuine. There was never a snicker 
  or a snarl, never a dark brooding, violent emotion. Whether in tears or triumph 
  the emotions of Jesus were noble, wise, good and perfectly righteous. Then there 
  are the direct references.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A survey of any good systematic theology such as Erickson or Grudem will find 
  a wealth of information under the heading &quot;the humanity of Jesus&quot; 
  as well as a good discussion of the complexities this entails (such as how the 
  divine and the human were combined in one person). I will leave these intricacies 
  to the theologians and will just list some of the biblical references which 
  show how complete His humanity and emotional life was: Jesus experienced hunger 
  (Matt 4:2, 21:18), thirst (Jn 19:28) , fatigue (Jn 4:6) , He rejoiced at the 
  end of the sending out of the seventy-two (Luke 10:21), marveled at the faith 
  of the centurion (Matthew 8:10) and felt love for the rich, young ruler (Mark 
  10:21) . His most frequent emotion is compassion which is recorded 11 times 
  in the gospels (eg Matthew 9:36). Anger was part of life for Jesus such as when 
  He became angry at the Pharisees for their hardened cruelty (Mark 3:5) . Zeal 
  for God's honor caused Him to cleanse the temple (John 2:17) . He grew in stature 
  and in wisdom and in favor with God and man (Luke 2:52) was subjected to high-powered 
  temptation (Matthew 4:1-11) , and learned obedience without sinning (Hebrews 
  5:8-9) . He had some of life's more painful emotions as well. For instance He 
  wept (Luke 19:41, John 11:35) , His soul was troubled (John 12:27) and a while 
  later He was &quot;troubled in spirit&quot; (John 13:21) . He underwent extreme 
  emotional distress to the point of death (Matthew 26:36-41) and prayed with 
  loud cries and tears (Hebrews 5:7) . Finally of course he experienced an agonizing 
  death on a cross. (Matthew 27:34-54) with its attendant feelings of abandonment 
  (Matthew 27:46) . </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The way Jesus processed His emotional life can also be deduced from some of 
  the incidents in His life. For instance He was extraordinarily calm in the face 
  of storms and authoritative even in the face of arrest. He was an accessible 
  person who was a &quot;friend of sinners&quot; and seemed to enjoy a reasonable 
  social life with stable friendships with His disciples and with the household 
  of Lazarus, Mary and Martha at Bethany. He had an inner circle of Peter, James 
  and John and the apostle John seems to have been a true friend and was known 
  as &quot;the disciple whom Jesus loved&quot;. Thus there is sufficient evidence 
  from direct references, incidents in the gospels and proper theological inference 
  to construct a reasonable portrait of the emotional life of Jesus - at least 
  one that can inform our discussion of biblical EQ.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Objection 4: Jesus is not a culturally relevant or gender relevant model 
  for the emotional life I lead. To ask me to model my emotional life on His is 
  inappropriate.</b></p>
<p>Solution: The cultural details of Jesus life are scant. God seems to have mainly 
  preserved only those details about Jesus that are relevant for all places and 
  times. </p>
<p>The core message of who Jesus is has been perceived by Jew and Gentile, slave 
  and free, male and female down the centuries. We will find out that Jesus shows 
  us how to cope with pressure, express anger, set limits and boundaries, participate 
  in grief and feel for the lost, the sick and the downtrodden. No one argues 
  that Jesus shows us how to have compassion and love as our primary emotional 
  realities. These are the sort of principles that survive cultural and gender 
  differences. Each of the EQ skills that Jesus displayed is written into Scripture 
  for our instruction. Much about His personality is left out - even such vital 
  details as His age or His personal preferences. This means that those details 
  that are in there (e.g. He is recorded 9 times as saying thanks at meals) are 
  ones that the Holy Spirit wanted to draw attention to and are largely personality 
  independent. [ In the case of &#147;saying grace&#148; it is the value of being 
  thankful and cultivating a life of gratitude for daily provision.] Millions 
  of people in dozens of cultures find the gospel accounts of Jesus highly relevant 
  to their situation. Using Jesus as our model means following what Scripture 
  says not what medieval paintings portray. There is no indication that Jesus 
  had a beard or long hair or was slightly effeminate looking. All these cultural 
  details are absent from the gospels. What is present is the account of a person 
  with a remarkable understanding of humanity and an enormous desire to heal it 
  and redeem it. If we mould our passions on His passions we will be highly relevant 
  people in a very needy world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Objection 5: Jesus had a totally different spiritual gifting. I could never 
  be as assertive, confident or confrontational as He comes across as in the gospel 
  narratives.</b></p>
<p>Solution: Becoming like Jesus is not about becoming a clone of a prophet but 
  is a unique journey of self-discovery. </p>
<p>God does make us each very different and He certainly does not ask us all to 
  be evangelists or prophets. In fact it is quite clear that there is no one &quot;right&quot; 
  Christian personality. Some are like Peter or Paul, while others resemble Moses, 
  Daniel, Barnabas or Elijah. Yet as different as each of these people are or 
  were, each of them was Christ-like. There is almost a trick to this. If I imitate 
  another human e.g. Billy Graham, I end up not being myself in the end yet if 
  I imitate Jesus the reverse happens &#150; I find myself. This is because Jesus 
  is the center of humanity and the crown of humanity and we were all created 
  by Him and for Him and in him everything holds together, including our personalities 
  (Colossians 1:15-20). Thus becoming like Jesus is like a journey to the center 
  of the Universe, full of adventures and surprises where we end up back where 
  we began but marvelously transformed. When the timid person decides to become 
  like Jesus he finds new boldness. When the sarcastic wit decides to become like 
  Jesus she finds new gentleness and tact. When the messed up and confused person 
  decides to become like Jesus, clarity appears as if from nowhere. The gospels 
  talk about losing yourself in order to find yourself and indeed we do. One person 
  sets out, another returns who is somewhat similar but entirely different. The 
  timid person loses their fear that they have harbored for so long, the sarcastic 
  person loses their cruelty, the disordered person loses their freedom to be 
  foolish. No-one becoming like Jesus becomes a clone. Its not a journey to a 
  single point, a &#147;dot&#148; we must all approximate. We don&#146;t all end 
  up in Jerusalem wearing sandals. Maybe it&#146;s a bit like a spiritual black 
  hole in which we seem to vanish but actually end up on a journey in another 
  Universe traveling faster than the speed of light .</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Objection 6: Jesus was tactless and His &quot;high EQ&quot; just got Him 
  crucified. That is not something ordinary people should imitate. They should 
  be tactful and careful.</b></p>
<p>Solution: Jesus was not tactless, He was an effective agent of change and a 
  brilliant communicator who was steadfastly opposed. His EQ skills made Him effective 
  and powerful and thus are worth imitating.</p>
<p>The ministry of Jesus and His EQ skills seem to have gone through three stages:</p>
<p>Favor: First Jesus grew in favor with God and man (Luke 2:52). Secondly His 
  early ministry was characterized by people being astonished at the gracious 
  words that fell from His lips. (Luke 4:22). At this stage His EQ skills make 
  Him perceptive, gracious and tactful. </p>
<p>Effectiveness: Where He taught with authority and challenged the teachings 
  of the scribes and the Pharisees. Some opposed, many listened, His following 
  grew. His opponents were infuriated by Him, but at this stage they were not 
  yet afraid of him. At this stage His EQ skills make Him authoritative and effective 
  as a public speaker and prophetic teacher</p>
<p>Power: Jesus eventually became a national political and religious figure that 
  many people wanted to see become King. He was able to challenge the highest 
  authorities in the land and to create genuine fear in His opponents. His enemies 
  were now truly afraid of Him and plotted His death like that of any political 
  enemy. At this stage His EQ skills make Him a skilful leader of a mass movement 
  and also someone able to withstand enormous pressure and persecution.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For Christians the development of a high biblical EQ goes through these same 
  three stages of favor, effectiveness and power . Stage One is &quot;growing 
  in favor&quot; where EQ skills are honed and refined and poor strategies are 
  discarded. Stage Two is effectiveness where EQ skills are honed in one's own 
  home town and district and an effective and authoritative ministry develops. 
  Stage Three is power when EQ skills are used to effect large scale change in 
  one's community such as being a community organizer, politician, writer, moral 
  crusader, preacher or evangelist. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>These latter stages generally provoke a reaction from the Evil One who launches 
  his attacks against the now highly effective Christian. Two Scriptures are relevant 
  here:</p>
<p>(2 Timothy 3:12 NKJV) Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus 
  will suffer persecution.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(Matthew 16:24-28 NKJV) Then Jesus said to His disciples, &quot;If anyone desires 
  to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me. 
  {25} &quot;For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses 
  his life for My sake will find it. {26} &quot;For what profit is it to a man 
  if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul? Or what will a man give 
  in exchange for his soul? {27} &quot;For the Son of Man will come in the glory 
  of His Father with His angels, and then He will reward each according to his 
  works.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Godliness will attract the scorn of some and the hatred of a few. If those 
  few occupy places of power than the persecution can be trying indeed. Nevertheless 
  we are called to be lights in the midst of darkness and sheep in the midst of 
  wolves; as wise as serpents and as innocent as doves. A high EQ will enable 
  you to skillfully handle high level social and political issues and be a real 
  influence for good in your society. However this will attract attention, envy, 
  rivalry, and in some cases ridicule, scorn and hatred. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The prophet Daniel is a prime example of this. His high biblical EQ , wisdom 
  and maturity made him effective and influential but made others envious and 
  landed him in the lions den amongst other places. But God delivered him! My 
  experience of Christian political involvement is that the persecution is always 
  more than I wanted but always far less than I feared. If you strive to attain 
  the EQ of Jesus Christ you will eventually become so gracious, poised, and authoritative 
  that you will have a real presence that makes a difference at national and international 
  levels. Unfortunately you will also have real enemies opposing the righteous 
  changes that you are seeking to bring about. Then its time to take up your cross 
  and follow Him! </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b><br>
  So we see that Jesus is indeed a very adequate, and in fact ideal model for 
  the development of the Christian&#146;s emotional life. This is a high calling 
  and in some ways a daunting one. How did Jesus cope? What gave Him the strength? 
  Or as His neighbors in Nazareth said when He returned from the wilderness &#147;Where 
  did He get this wisdom from?&#148; From the Holy Spirit! And the work of the 
  Holy Spirit in the life of Jesus &#150; particularly in His emotions, soul and 
  spirit, is the subject of the next fascinating chapter. </p>
